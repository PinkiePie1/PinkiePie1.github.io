>Night Sophisticated Sonar in Equestria
>Be Anonymous
>Your alarm sounds and you roll lazily to one side of your bed
>The time is eight at night and you need to be at work in an hour
>You roll from your bed with all the enthusiasm you can muster and ready yourself for the night
>After a quick cold shower, you head over to your armour stand and begin to don your suit
>Just another day on 'the force' you think as your helmet slides onto your head
>You march from your home with a clatter not unlike dishpans falling to the floor as you make your way to your post
>The night air is still and clouds hang heavy in their heavens and you settle in for another uneventful day at the castle
>Your first hour is quiet as you stand still with you spear at your side
>Occasionally, you would hear the voices from the tower above you of noble ponies speaking about nothing in particular
>You often wonder what nobles do at night and take a moment to mock up a few scenarios
>The first thing you come up with is that nobles must prepare for the next day
>Surely, they would have speeches to give and some kind of agenda
>Though you've never met a noble who actually did anything noticeably difficult
>So you think a bit longer until your mind wanders into more scandalous territory
>You would not be surprised if the night sees its share of adultery in the otherwise boring and gray walls of Canterlot Castle
>A smile plays over your face as you think about all the dirty secrets of your employer's
>The night air parts suddenly and you stand straight at attention
>A black chariot soars through the sky in your direction and you know exactly where this is going
>Within moments, two night guards touch down and stand before you
>The large rider steps from her platform on shining hooves and looks upon you with a stern demeanor
>It is the Princess of the Night in the flesh and, oddly enough, another pony you do not recognize
>Princess Luna gracefully walks towards you with her head held high and her cosmic mane flows unnaturally in the still air
>"Guard Anonymous, how does the night find you?"
"Finds us well, dear Princess. Can I be of service to you?"
>"In fact, you can! I have here a new trainee..."
>She motions for the smaller pony to join her by her side
>"This is Nightlight and she is a new recruit into the ranks of the royal night watch. I am tasking you with her training, if you feel up to such task?"
>You think for a moment about having to haul around a new recruit for the next few weeks and Luna looks at your face as if trying to read you
>"It does come with such benefits as extra rations and increased pay."
>You keep your steadfast expression as you rattle the idea about
>The money would be nice, but is not necessary
>Luna looks you over again and you catch a glimpse of apprehension wearing on her muzzle
>"What if I offer you a larger room?"
>You let a smile slip and Luna returns it in kind
>She must have been listening to your only complaint since you started working her so long ago
"I think this is a fair increase, Princess. I will be happy to take up the young stallion."
>The thought of a larger room motivates you greatly and you let your attention slide just long enough for Luna to correct you in her usual frank manner
>"I am sorry to inform you, but your young ward will be a mare."
>An oddly satisfied smile crosses her lips as she pushes your new apprentice towards you
"That is fine by me, Princess."
>It would mean you do not even have to bunk up!
>"Then it is settled! I shall make preparations for your belongings to be moved to your new residence!"
>Without too much ceremony, Princess Luna returns to her chariot and takes off to somewhere you don't care to know
>Silence holds the night air as you look over the guard before you
>Her small size hardly supports the armour strewn upon her frame and her wide, naÃ¯ve eyes tell you the story of a youthful life
>Figures that you would be stuck with this much work, but it is surely worth every minute to finally have some space
"Alright, sentry! Attention is the name of the game!"
>You puff out your chest and keep your voice at a steady tone
"My name is Anonymous, but you will call me, 'Sir', do you understand?"
>"Yes, Sir!"
>You smirk quickly as the small mare salutes and tries to keep her eyes straight ahead
"Well, then... We have five more hours of duty. Is this your first time on watch?"
>"No, Sir! I've been on night watch three times already, Sir!"
>Her voice is a bit higher than you would have thought and it pops on certain words
>You laugh internally while staring intensely at her
"Good, then tell me, what is our duty?"
>"Our duty is to watch and protect the Castle against all her enemies, Sir!"
"And what does the night guard value above all else?"
>"We value speed and stealth, Sir!"
"And what punishment shall we bestow upon those who attempt to sever the peace we strive to maintain?"
>Nightlight is suddenly quiet and her eyes seem to roam towards you
>You are the first to break the stillness with your concise answer
"Uncompromised attack at all costs. Remember that..."
>"Sir, yes, Sir!"
>You dismiss the little mare and leave her in your stead while you move across to the opposite wall
>Covering twice as much ground is both good for your work and good for the castle
>Over the next hour, you watch Nightlight carefully
>Her form is well and you can see her ears move about as she listens for anything out of the ordinary
>Every now and again, her eyes would wonder about and you would let out a gruff noise to snap her to attention
>Another silent hour passes you before your stomach alerts that it is time for food
>You wave Nightlight over to you and she hesitates for the moment
>Not wanting to come off as too strict, you approach her and speak softly
"Sentry Nightlight... could I interest you in a snack?"
>"Um, yes, Sir?"
"At ease... we are on break..."
>"Are we suppose to be on break? I haven't worked more than a four-hour shift..."
"No worries, mine is a an extended workload so we are permitted to a light rest so long as the world looks calm. Would you say it is calm tonight?"
>Nightlight looks at you seriously before removing her helmet
>You have seen many ponies in your time, but something about her ears caught you off-guard
>They are long and equally as wide with tufts of fur around the tips
>Her ears bounce around with a supernatural speed before she smiles to you
>"I don't hear anything suspicious, Sir."
>You take a long look at her features in the moonlight to find some surprising traits
>Her coat is a bluish-gray and her eyes glow with a faint green hue, a bit uncharacteristic of most night guard stock
>Glancing at her muzzle reveals a few pronounced canines and you find yourself needing to ask a few questions
"Nightlight, who is your sire?"
>"Oh... um... do you know Thunder Storm?"
"I cannot say I do. Is he with the royal guard?"
>"No, he works in Cloudsdale with the weather patrol."
"Interesting that you would find yourself here, but congratulations on making it this far."
>"Thank you, Sir."
>You retrieve a loaf of bread, some peanut butter and fresh fruit
>Having the good fortune of requisitioning apples from the nearby farms was a privilege reserved for yourself
>It never hurt to make friends with the locals, especially when you worked in such a position that made others suspicious of you
>The fresh apple in your hand causes Nightlight's head to whip around quickly
>She salivates and you notice her tongue is curiously long for her muzzle
"Ah, do you like apples?"
>"Any kind of fruit, Sir. Sweet, juicy fruit..."
>She stares at the apple with wide eyes and glides her lewd tongue over her lips
>You pass her the apple and she catches it between her jaws
>The fangs pierce the apple's white meat with a loud crunching sound as apple scented drool streams from the mare's face
>Nightlight beams back at you as her grotesque tongue cleans her from nose to chin
"Another question... if you would. Just what kind of pony are you?"
>Devouring her apple, Nightlight looks over to you with puffed cheeks 
>She swallows quickly before turning away from you and speaking lowly
>"It's, uh, it's kind of a long story..."
"Sentry, you do not deny an answer to your commanding officer."
>She looks to you and you smile wickedly before chuckling
"No, no, I joke. I am sure you are wondering what -I- am, after all."
>"Princess Luna said you were something call a, 'human'. She said it was like a Minotaur, but not as confrontational... usually."
>Her eyes narrow as she speaks and you aren't quite sure what she is thinking
"Ah, Princess Luna has a way with words. Always complimenting me."
>"Well, I'm a bat... a bat pony... it's kind of different."
>You raise your eyebrow casually before returning to your otherwise normal expression of boredom 
"I had so much as a feeling. You are not the first I have met in the night guard. I think it's becoming popular for nocturnal types to find work in the night watch."
>"So, so, you don't think it's weird?"
"Why would I think that, sentry?"
>"I don't know... it's just... it's nothing."
>She sits rather still for the moment as you look her over
>You think there are entire squadrons of night guards who share similar characteristics, but Nightlight herself seems to be a bit doubtful
>That is not a good trait; doubt
>You plan to correct that before your lessons are over
"Interesting... well, we should return to our posts shortly. There will be more time to discuss anything you'd like later. Feel free to think up questions for me and reflect on tonight's lessons. There will be a test."
>Nightlight smiles and laughs a light, girly laugh, but you do not share her amusement
"Truly, I am testing you after our shift..."
>You pack up your goods and salute Nightlight smartly
>She returns the sentiment and briskly trots to her post
>The next few hours roll in and out without much sound
>There is a moment where you are sure you heard someone trotting through the grounds, but it was only the Princess' student, Twilight Sparkle
>She was dressed in some odd cat-suit, but you do not think much of it
>That girl has been a little peculiar since you've first met her and both princesses think she's special to some degree or another
>The final hour approaches as the first rays of golden sunlight stretch over the walls and invade your once cool position
>Nightlight lets out a small sigh as the sunshine touches her
>Her silver armour gleams with an unpolished shine and you imagine the suit is a hand-me-down 
>You will teach her how to take care of her armour in time for a guard is nothing without it
>She does not seem armed with any weapon, which is fairly normal for newer recruits
>The dawn finally arrives and you sigh happily to yourself as the boring evening leaves you
>Your relief comes in the form of a white stallion in brilliant polished armor
"Commander."
>You nod to him as he passes you and stand at attention
>"Hmm, Guard Anonymous. I didn't know you work on the western wall?'
"I am a man of many talents, sir."
>You chuckle before the two of you break down the facade of ranking
"Haven't seen you in a while! How's the missus?"
>"Better than you'd expect with how much I'm away these days! We even just found out that we have a, -ahem-, new edition to the royal guard on the way."
"You sly devil, you! Glad to hear it."
>You hand him your nightly report and he takes it in his magic
>A quick glance confirms that it was another boring night
>The unicorn snorts once before approaching Nightlight
>"Ah, the new mare. I've heard you'd be on duty."
>She salutes him quickly and stands with a dire expression plastered to her face
>"Sir, yes, sir!"
>Nightlight lets go a yelp somewhere between terror and hemorrhoid pain before the Commander nods to her
>He looks back to you and smiles broadly
>"I see you have yet another pony under your metaphorical wing."
"The Princess seems to really trust me. I think, perhaps, I have a way with ponies."
>"Why don't you just take the promotion already? You know it's just sitting there, waiting for you to come and join the elites."
>You laugh lowly and wave your hand in the air
"Too stuffy for me, personally. I am rather fond of this job."
>"You'll come around someday. You've got too much talent and time here to be doing shift work."
>The Commander is always a breath of fresh air for you, truly a pony you're proud to call your superior
>You say your goodbyes and watch as the Commander casts a large, magical bubble over the castle
>It fades from a deep pink to a translucent shield encompassing the sky
>Magic always impresses you, but you'd never let the unicorn caste know, especially not the Commander
>Nightlight quickly matches your stride as you begin the trek to your old home
>A note on the door halts your progress and you read it over carefully
>Apparently, you new home is closer to the center staging grounds, not far from the combat training fields
>"Excuse me, Sir?"
"At ease... call me Anonymous off-duty. What can I do for you?"
>"That was the Commander back there?"
"Yes, and you came off rather green. I was sure you would fall over in fright."
>You smirk quickly before heading to your new dwelling
>The two of you reach your home in no time and you find it to be much larger than you would have asked for
>There is so much extra space that they found room for another bed and a second armour rack
>You would dare say it was large enough for two bodies... to...
"Nightlight... where are your quarters?"
>"Um, the Princess said my room would be in the Militia Garrison. Oh, look! My bed!"
>She enters the room with mild excitement before sliding her gear off and stacking it haphazardly on the pony shaped equipment stand
>This wasn't part of the bargain!
>As if hearing your angry thoughts from space, the sound of Princess Luna's voice picks up from behind you
>"Ah, good day, Guard Anonymous! Guard Nightlight. I hope you find these new accommodations fitting?"
"Dear Princess, this is not proper procedure. We do not have coed sleeping quarters."
>"This I know... there are a few issues with space, currently, and I found this would be the best way for you to keep a close eye on your current trainee. Besides, coed applies to guards that might make other guards at a spur of the moment. I do not worry about such activities with you."
>Luna grins widely as if daring you to say something and you have trouble holding back your true feelings
"Is it a temporary situation?"
>"I believe so. We are in the process of building another storage room to try and alleviate the recent recruitment rooster."
"Are we planning to defend in the near future?"
>Your face keeps your unperturbed appearance, but something inside you flip-flops with uncertainty
>After the attack on the Princess in the Changeling raid, you have been a bit more on edge
>"No, Anonymous, we do not believe our enemies have the means to assault us just yet. Though, it never hurts to have a few extra sets of hooves around, just in case."
>You nod in agreement before looking to Nightlight
"I will do as we agreed. Under my watch, she will be a powerful new addition to the night watch."
>Luna smiles softly now and steps in close enough to whisper
>"Treat her well, Anonymous. She is special."
>You hope that your eyes did not roll at the word, 'special' as the Princess takes her leave
>So many times you come upon a pony deemed, 'special' only to find they are as ordinary and simple as weeds in a garden
>The door closes against the sunlight and you remove your armour with practice grace
>It hangs neatly on your tall rack and you smile at the final craftsmanship 
>A voice surprises you as Nightlight appears from behind you
>"How do you get your gear so shiny?"
"An excellent question!"
>You rummage about for a bucket, a coarse sponge and a bottle of fine mineral oil
"For your test, as we spoke of, you are tasked with restoring your armour to a shine one step beyond my own and then polishing my armour to a step above your newly polished armour."
>You drop the bucket at her hooves and grin 
"You have one hour, which is just about the same time I will be returning."
>"W-what? You're leaving?"
"For an hour, yes. Do you need me to hold your hoof just to scrub some dirty metal?"
>"No, of course not! I... I just thought that maybe we would, I don't know, do something?'
"I will be doing something, you will be doing something. So, in essence, you are correct!"
>She frowns as you don more casual wear and head towards the door
"Ah, yes, if you get hungry, feel free to search the barrels in the back for food. I know there should be a crate of apples lying around here somewhere."
>With a small sigh, you set out into the daylight
>Something is bothering you and your gut has a certain affinity for being right
>Instinct alone will not clear your head, so it is time to meet a particular friend at her library
>Best to keep your ward preoccupied, bad enough you are already worrying yourself to tears
>The wind lifts up just right as you look to the thin tower of the castle and see a candle burning in the window
"Another favour... she won't mind..."
>You set off into the morning sun, the Night cannot hide its secrets forever

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Day Easily Confused Prophets in Equestria
>Be Nightlight
>You grumble as you dip your hoof in the pail of water again and work at scrubbing your armor 
"Stupid... dirt... come off... already!"
>You put your shoulder into and grit your teeth as you polish
>It's been nearly half a hour and you barely got your helmet to shine
>When your instructor returns, he is going to think you've been slacking and then you're really going to get it!
>You grab the bottle of polish in your mouth and squeeze a gooey drop of oil directly onto the smooth metal
>It slides down slowly, leaving a trail of black in its wake
>Your hoof works tirelessly with the wiry brush as you muscle into the filthy metal
>There has got to be a better way to clean this stuff!
>You scan around the room before seeing a lantern and some oil
"It... it just might work..."
>A smile crosses your toothy mouth 

>Atop a tower filled with books and scrolls
>Be Anonymous
"What do you mean that's all the time I get?! I paid you well enough for an hour!"
>The old hag of a pony looks over you with a shoddy grin
>"If you think I can just conjure up whatever you want whenever you want, you're dead wrong, sonny!"
>She lunges out with her walking stick and bops you on the head
>You wince and hold the sore spot before looking back at her with scorn
"Thieving crone! That is the last time I use your divination services!"
>"Eh, you'll be back..."
"Did your stupid leaves tell you that?"
>"No, the fact that we do this almost every time did..."
>Filthy logic using hag!
>You storm from her tower and descend the staircase
>As you walk through the palace, a servant approaches you with an urgent look on his face
>"Guards! Help! Fire!"
"Where is the fire?"
>The servant lifts his hoof in the direction of the combat training fields and you rush onwards
>Thinking quickly, you summon up a handful of unicorn guards and grab a bucket
>You step out into the daylight to see that there is a fire burning and it happens to be burning in your newly acquisitioned garrison home
>Terror takes hold of you and your face flushes white as you think of your ward
"Nightlight..."
>You hand a bucket of water to the nearest unicorn guard and begin racing towards the inferno
"Suppress these flames! Dirt and water! Snuff them at the edges!"
>Adrenaline courses through you as you reach the garrison door and tear it open
>The hot metal handle scolds your palms, but you can't feel much right now
>You walk through the blaze with your head down low to see the ground
>A voice rings out in a corner of the room and your eyes dark to it
>"Help! Somep0ny, help me!"
>You grab the nearest solid thing you can find and bat the flames leading to Nightlight
"Get up! We need to go!"
>Fear crosses her face as she looks to you, but you decide there is no time for speaking
>You grab her by the foreleg and drag her out
>Her back legs kick in protest as you forcefully lift her to your chest and begin running
>The garrison beams begin to creak as the flames lick away at the supports and you barrel through the open door way
>You fall out into the street with soot covering your face and ash in your throat
>A team of medics rush on your location and you hand them Nightlight with what strength you have left
>The sound of a pony speaking to you makes you turn your head, but the sounds are muffled by exhaustion
>A hoof twists your head to face the noise as you start to black out
>The last thing you see is Princess Celestia standing over you with a poignant stare before the darkness takes you

>In an infirmary ward not far from your garrison
>Be Nightlight
>"Now, take it easy, dear. You are just in a bit of shock. Let me bandage up that hoof."
>You rest your hoof on the small counter as the nurse begins her work
>"Other than fright, I'd say you made it out in decent shape. Was terribly afraid you might have burnt your wings."
>You try to speak, but nothing comes out of your mouth
>This is all your fault, you know it to be true
>Beside your bed is the current resting place of your instructor or, more precisely, what is left of him
>His hands were burnt, the nurse used the term, 'badly', and he has a bit in his mouth to keep it propped open
>After a long look at his unconscious form, you turn back to the nurse tending to your hoof
"Is... he..."
>She looks up to you with steely, practiced eyes
>"Not dead... that one's a fighter. Had him here a few times before. But, I don't know how he's doing."
>A few other medical personnel come by and a unicorn places his horn on your instructor's chest
>He sits and listens, perhaps even feels the heartbeat before removing his horn
>"Steady, if a little weak... Keep and eye on him."
>Another unicorn nods quickly as the first leaves the area
"Sir... Anonymous, Sir. Can you hear me?"
>The body lies peacefully on the bed as you speak with no hint of activity
>You take a good look at his unarmored, disrobed body and marvel at the strange human thing
>There are numerous wounds on the better half of his torso and some of the burns look blistery already
>You internally pray to somep0ny to come and help him
>As if by a miracle, the door's of the infirmary open wide and in steps Princess Celestia herself
>She trots gallantly towards the bed you are hovering around
>"Oh, Anonymous... why must you always play the hero?'
>She quickly looks across to you with a faint smile
>"Hello, my little pony, I take it you are doing well?"
>You nod, too awestruck to speak
>Celestia's horn begins to glow and you feel the very fabric of space around the room draw into the building energy
>Your sensitive skin feels the tug a little more as a ball of brilliant light eases it way to the tip of the Princess' horn
>She lays it down upon Anonymous chest and his skin readily absorbs it
>Celestia wobbles for a brief second before resuming her regal stance
>The room feels quiet now and the weight of a million words rest on your back
>Suddenly, there comes a choking cough from Anonymous and you tear up
"He's awake! Oh, thank you, Princess!"
>She smiles and nods as if listening, but not listening at all
>Her face suddenly hangs and her eyes glaze over a bit
>Whatever spell she just used seemed to drain a tremendous amount of energy from her being and even the other unicorns in the room seem a bit dizzy
>Anon finally stirs and his eyes open
>"Ah... what a dream... what did I miss?"
>Celestia smiles to him earnestly before speaking
>"Worry not, dear Anonymous. The fires were put down and your heroic actions saved the life of Nightlight."
>"Oh, good, I thought I picked her up. Glad that part wasn't the dream..."
>He groans in pain as he raises his arm
>"Agh-Anonymous... requesting permission to sleep, your highness?"
>"Permission granted..."
>The Princess calls for you to follow her and gestures for everyp0ny around to give Anonymous his space
>You feel a familiar fear of utter defeat in your stomach again as you walk away 
>Celestia's imposing form glides along the floor as if she weighed nothing at all
>"Nightlight, correct?"
"Y-Yes, sir."
>"Did you see how this fire may have started?"
>Your voice chokes as if a hoof were pinning down your throat as you attempt to get the words out
"I-it was a l-lantern. Fell o-off a sh-helf. I c-could... I c-couldn't stop it."
>You look like a leaf in an autumn hurricane right now
>The Princess looks over you a few times before speaking in a stern voice
>"Thank the heavens you were not serious injured. I hate to say it like this, but Anon's body can withstand much greater damage than I have ever witness anyp0ny take."
>You find this information encouraging, albeit gruesome
"Will he... is he going to... when will he be on his hooves again?"
>The Princess lets out a drawn sigh before speaking straight ahead
>"That, my little pony, is up to him now."
>She breaks away to go meet with a small group of ponies and you find yourself standing completely still in the hall
>The door to the outside is a scant five yards from you, but you can't help from turning back and trotting to the infirmary
>You arrive at Anonymous' bedside again and decide you will do what he would want you to do in this situation; guard
>Your hoof strikes the floor sharply as you position yourself accordingly
>Determination burns in your eyes as you plan to keep Anon in his sleeping, blissful state
>You easily keep all curious ponies at bay until another doctor approaches
"State your name and business."
>The stallion looks up at you quickly with a bit of confusion in his eye
>"I'm sorry... this is the patient with the burns, right?"
"Yes, name and business."
>"Dr. Trotson and I'm the pony who's here to clean him up."
>You decide the white coat checks out and you grant him access
>He draws back the curtains and you see Anonymous' eyes are open and searching about
>They seem to relax when he finally spies you and he lets go a groan that might be a sigh
>"Hmm, mostly superficial... the blistering will sting a bit."
>The doctor's horn glows lightly before he freezes in place."
>His mouth moves, yet no words come from him 
>He backs up slightly and looks to you with fearful eyes
>"Has Celestia been here already?"
"Yes, she came in an hour ago."
>You keep to the point, short and concise
>"My word... -this- is his conditions after her magic? I... Well, this will be difficult. You are his caretaker, I assume?"
>Your head nearly spins in place and your guard falls, unmasking your emotion
"Caretaker? No, sir, you have it all wrong. I'm his apprentice! I'm in -his- care!"
>A small medical kit lifts in the doctor's magic and he pushes it unto you
>"He'll need someone to care for his wounds. Someone at home to help him get around while he recovers. Does he have a... wife?"
>The doctor hesitates at the word after looking over the strange form of Anon
"I-I don't know! I just got here yesterday!"
>Your squeaking alerts Anon and her turns his head with another moan
>"Miss, please. Calm yourself around the patient."
>A fear wells up in your chest as you see Anon hurt himself again for your sake
>This is too strange for you and your mind races with options
>"I need an answer; can you be his caretaker or not?"
>Your heart pounds in your chest as you look over to the body in the bed
>You've never cared for another before and you aren't sure where to even begin
>This is not your duty either, you think, it would be unfair to take this responsibility
>A thunderous voice calls out from the opposite end of the room
>"Where is he?! Where is Guard Anon?!"
>Princess Luna stands in the door way with a vicious demeanor
>She storms on wings of blackness towards you
>"By the light of the moon..."
>She looks you over and then Anonymous as her face tenses
>"My sister did not exaggerate. Doctor, what is the status of this one?"
>"Stable, unable to care for himself at the current time. I was asking this mare if she will be his keeper for the next few days, but..."
>You speak quickly before your Princess as seriously as you can
"Princess Luna, we need a new garrison home for Anonymous. Somewhere without stairs."
>"Already done, will you take up this task set before you, Nightlight?"
>You nod as your gut objects with a bit of a lurch
"I will, Princess, for you..."
>Her hoof crosses the air swiftly as she cuts off your words
>"No, you do this for Anonymous..."
>You breathe deeply and start again
"I will do it for Anonymous."
>The floating box of medical supplies rests in your mouth as you take hold of your new task
>Over the next hour, Anonymous' body is moved to a new garrison at the base of the magical studies room and what is left of your armor and belongs finds its way over
>All of it is scuffed with black soot and flame marks
>A harsh reminder of the recent events, you don't think they will clean away given any amount of time
>The first pleasant sign you have all day is when Anonymous finally speaks to you
>His voice is a little hoarse, but it does not look difficult for him
>"Nightlight... how is your hoof? I did not mean to pull so hard."
>You look at the bandages leg and back to the charred flesh in front of you
"I am fine... It's fine. How do you feel?"
>"Aching... sore hands... headache... a little hungry. Not unlike my first day of basics."
>He attempts to laugh, but a painful, chocking cough is all that comes out
>You cannot believe his resolve
>Anyp0ny in this situation would surely be miserable and here you have this human making jokes about his abused body
>"It's time for me to change your dressing... Um, so... here I go!"
>He remains still for you as you peel back the medical tape and uncover a gory scene
>You choke back the bile in your throat as you look over the mess
>"My... if I'd known you were squeamish, we would have practice on cutting red meat first."
"W-Why would we do that?"
>"Cut up enough bloody hunks of meat and you are sure to get over it."
>He smiles as you apply the cleaning salve to the wound before wincing at the healing sting
>You past the new gauze on him and see him looking at your face intently
"What? What is it?"
>"Ears..."
>His hand reaches up slowly and you allow him to touch the tuft of fur at the tip of your ear
>The feeling is odd, but not unpleasant
>Anonymous removes his hand after a moment and you look up his body
>"I've been meaning to... invade your personal space... I find it helps to break the tension of my hands."
>He wheezes a little as he speaks, you think the pad hurts
"I'm not afraid of you."
>"Good... keep your lunch down on the next wound."
>It takes a while longer to properly apply all the medical pads, but you do an admirable job
"OK... um, do you want the sponge bath now?"
>His eyes raise and fall as he holds down another chuckle
>"I'll survive without it, thank you. Do you have any food laying around?"
>You quickly race around and pick up a bunch of fruits before bringing them back
"What kind of fruits does a human eat?"
>"Meat... Do we have meat?"
"What? No, fruit!"
>"I need red meat. See if there is a ration pack marked with my name."
>You rummage through a crate and, to your surprise, find a few white packages addressed to Anonymous
>You return with one and brandish it before him
>"Yes, perfect..."
>He reaches out only to drop his arm in pain
"No, wait! I'll get it for you! Don't exert yourself."
>Anonymous suddenly seems very reserved about your opening the parcel
>What ever silly idea was in your head quickly fades as the smell of seared flesh hits your nose
>The white, seemingly harmless package contains the unfortunate remains of something 
>Strips of flesh lay evenly across and carry the scent of coals and you find yourself gagging at the sight
>"I am sorry, it is the second hardest thing for ponies to accept about me."
>You look up at him and feel an odd sort of fear 
>Eating the flesh of animals is unheard of to you, but if this will help then you will do it
>A piece of the flesh rolls limply into your hoof and you cringe before lifting it to Anon's mouth
>He takes it into his mouth and in the most visceral, disgusting manner you could imagine, he tears it apart
>"Ah, that's the stuff... another, please."
>You repeat the process and watch with a queasy stomach as he devours more and more of the fleshy meat
>After consuming the entire package, he seems satiated and calm
>"Thank you, I know this must be difficult on you."
"You're the one bedbound, this is nothing. I am a good caretaker!"
>You squeak lightly on your words and Anon smiles
>"I... I have a present for you. Do you see a bound create?"
>Looking through the items scattered about, you find a locked box and nod back to Anon
>"Open it."
>You take a few steps away from the bed and move to the chest
>It opens easily before you and you look inside to see a short wooden pole with a sharp metal tip
"What is this? A spear?"
>"Your spear, to be exact. We start training... in a day or so..."
"Do you think... do you think you'll be ready? Don't push yourself so hard."
>"I can feel Celestia's magic coursing through me. I have suffered worse than this, I promise! You are not trying to get out of your royal duties, are you?"
>You shake your head quickly and your mouth gapes
"Of course not, I love guard duty! I... I just want you to get better."
>"Good, that's what I like to hear..."
>He cringes a bit and you hear the sound of a bone snapping
"What in the hay?"
>"I think... I may have fractured... my wrist. It's now resetting..."
>Anonymous whimpers lightly as you hear another small pop and your skin crawls
>This whole day has been gruesome, you think
>"Think I'm going to try and sleep through this... You should get some sleep as well."
"No, I need to watch you. I am your designated care giver."
>"How can you care for me if you're tired?"
"Well, I'm not just going to leave you here! What if you wake in the middle of the day and get hungry or thirsty? Who'll be here to help you?"
>Anonymous sighs lightly with your stubbornness
>"Fine, get in."
"What was that?'
>"Get in bed, lie down on my right side. It's not too badly hurt."
>You look over his right arm and chest to see just as much damage as any where else
"I'm not certain..."
>"Then go find where you will be sleeping and have a rest. I need you in tip-top shape."
"Fine..."
>You give in and slowly climb into the spacious bed
"I made a promise and I always keep my promises."
>It takes a bit of careful maneuvering, but you finally manage to get comfortable without hurting Anon
>Being this close to your mentor is kind of awkward and you blush a little
>His hand seems to stroke your side lightly as you close your eyes
"Sir... if you need anything, I'll be right here."
>"At ease, Nightlight, get some rest."
>Falling asleep is not as difficult as you thought before laying down
>Something later, you awake to the sound of somep0ny knocking
>You slip from the still sleeping Anonymous and fly over to the door
>The door opens to reveal a tired Princess Celestia
>You are not sure you have ever seen her looking so worn-out before and it strikes you as curious
>She speaks quickly, but pleasantly to you
>"Ah, Nightlight, good evening. My sister was correct that you would be here."
>You bow to one hoof and dip your head before replying
"Yes, I am at Anonymous' side as tasked."
>"How is Anonymous doing?"
>Celestia attempts to push past you, but the narrow doorway impedes her
"He is doing well, sleeping now to be exact."
>She looks at you sternly and her figure seems more imposing than you remember
>"Take care of him and tell him that I have been here... when he wakes again."
>Her voice quavers for only a moment and her eyes seem to drupe 
>She smiles once before leaving you with a blink of her magic
>You get the strangest feeling that she wanted to speak with Anonymous, but it passes as quickly as it came
>The door closest slowly with a soft twisting noise and you head over to a crate of apples to get some breakfast
>You keep your eye fixed to Anonymous while you bite into a shiny green apple
>The sweet and sour taste is delectable between your fangs
>It is a bit troublesome to keep the noise from the wonderful meal down as you chew vigorously into a second juicy, red apple
>With a sigh of relief, your belly stops crying out and you feel strong and ready to seize the night
>Carpe noctem!
>After your internal cheering fest ends, you sit on the floor beside Anon's bed and watch vigilantly for any dangerous or what have you
>The night rolls in as Anon begins to stir for the first time in hours
>It is a welcome relief to your growing boredom and you salute him smartly
"All clear on the eastern front, Sir."
>"Good eyesight, soldier, we're on the western side of the court."
>You blush and quickly explain yourself
"I-I meant to say that! Sir! I meant to say, 'western', Sir!"
>He wheezes out a short laugh and looks to you
>"At ease, no training this night."
>You see his shoulder lift and his hand plants itself on the wooden frame of the bed
>His chest muscles tense and struggle before he lifts his body a few inches upward
>With a heavy wing beat, you race towards him
"Sir, I don't suggest you try to get up!"
>Your hoof presses against his body as he tries again
>"Nightlight, let go..."
>He struggles against you once more and you see the gauze padding on his chest begin to swell with a sickening pink
>"Nightlight, as your superior, I order you to let me go!"
>Anon places his other hand backward and adds a little more force
>You know what is best for him right now, but back down at his command
>His face is tense with pain and you can see blood lining the edges of the once white pads
>Finally sitting up in the bed, Anon huffs between labored breaths 
>"So... good evening... any news?"
"Yes, Princess Celestia came to visit about an hour ago."
>"Ah, that is kind of her."
>You see Anonymous' leg shift under his body slowly
"Oh no, Sir, I have to advise against standing up! You only have two legs, Sir!"
>"I am... fine... Nightlight..."
>As if by the grace of the heavens, Anonymous tires himself out from the pain and slumps backward
>"Maybe... later..."
>You wipe a bead of sweat from your forehead and try to be friendly with your teacher
"Can I interest you in some food, Sir?"
>He looks over at you with a curious smirk and licks his lips
>"That would be lovely. An apple, if you would?"
>You quickly bring him a red apple and grab the medical kit
>He begins to snack while you prep some new dressing, but his new position makes it a littler harder for you to work
"So, you can eat fruit?"
>"Sure, why not?"
"It's just, I saw you eat that meat from earlier... You're not like the Thirsters, are you?"
>"Thirsters? I am not sure I've ever encountered them."
"Well, there are other bat ponies, like myself, but we're all different. I'm more into fruit, but somep0nies, especially the Thirsters, really like blood and meat."
>"Can't say I'd blame them. It is deceivingly hard to get a good steak in this place."
>Anon chuckles once before becoming a little more serious
"Can you lay back down now? You tore open your wounds and they need looking after."
>"Hmm, perhaps this is a good time to practice field triage."
"Excuse me?"
>"Sometimes, in a real fight, we don't get time to lay out our living bodies for medical attention. Many field medics are trained to assist the wounded on foot or hoof as it were."
"You said there wasn't any training tonight?"
>"And now there is! Funny how that happens, no?"
>You nod a bit and think about it
>The prospect of a new lesson intrigues you and it will at least be something to pass the time
>"The idea is to work in less than ideal situations. This position is very hard for ponies thanks for my longer body. You might become the first to properly bandage the human body!"
>This idea gives you the burning desire to get it right
>You climb onto the bed and stand above Anon
>He looks to you and holds his arms out to his sides
>It is odd to look at him, but not as odd as you first thought
"OK, this might sting, so just tell me to stop if it hurts too much."
>You slowly peel back the medical wrapping and put them to one side
>Fresh, red blood leaks from him as he sits erect and you quickly apply the new gauze
>You had mild success at the upper angle, but the next bandage is a little different
"Um, uh, OK... just hang on."
>You turn your head upside-down to look at the wounded area 
>Your wing takes the edge of the dressing carefully and pulls it back
>A quick swap and you place the new dressing with a fair amount of success
"There we go. How does it feel?"
>"Stinging and irritating, not bad."
>You chest presses up against Anon's as you reach over to his next wound
>His body is very warm against your own 
>A quick bandage swap sees his old wounds in better condition
>"I have to thank you again..."
>You turn to look at Anon and see his face in full view
>It is kind of different when you are this close
>His muzzle doesn't look so short from this angle and his mane is kind of nice
>Even his small eyes seem a little larger and ever so brighter
>"Nightlight..."
>His voice buzzes in your head as you feel hot breath travel down your neck
"Y-Yes, Anon?"
>"Your getting blood all over your nice fur..."
>Did he just tell you that you have nice fur?
>You blush a bit and cover your mouth with you hoof 
"Oh, well I try to keep my coat healthy and..."
>The rest of his sentence finally catches up with your head and you quickly pull yourself away
"Agh! No, no, no!"
>Anonymous looks to you and laughs a bit as blood gushes from his body
>You try to hide your embarrassment with little success
>"The bandages feel secure enough. Had this been a field situation, I would have to give you an unsatisfactory mark."
>You quickly turn to look back at him with an astonished expression
"What? Why was it unsatisfactory?"
>"Distracted, caring too much about the injured fellow in front of you, and getting your suit dirty. The most careless thing of all."
>You were not distracted, it was all his fault anyways!
"Since this is just practice... did I do well enough... Sir?"
>"Oh, yes, a bang-up job! Thank you, again."
>This human has the personality of two, you think
>You look at him carefully from your vantage point
>His body is still damaged, but you don't think it looks as bad as it did hours ago
>Certainly not as bad as he had been in the hospital
>It does make you curious about Princess Celestia's visit and you feel Anonymous may be keeping secrets from you
"Anonymous, Sir. Why did Princess Celestia come here for you?"
>"I imagine she is wondering if I am recovering."
"But, she used her magic on you. Really powerful magic too."
>"Well, I suppose she is just being friendly."
>He gives you a disarming grin and you nod in agreement
>"The Princesses have always been rather friendly with me since my arrival. It is always a welcome benefit."
>Anon's eyes suddenly dart to one corner and you turn your head to follow
>His hand lifts up and touches your wing quickly while you are distracted
>You flap the wing a bit at the strange sensation 
"H-Hey! No fair!"
>"So easily distracted. We'll work on that."
>Anon rubs a length of your wing and it sends a shiver up your spine and back to your tail
"Oh, it tickles, please stop!"
>He does so almost as quickly as you ask him and you suddenly wish you let him go on for a little while longer
>"Are you going to straddle me all night after all?"
>He smirks at you and you see his teeth in the light for the first time
>They look not unlike your own and it makes you think
>You quickly flitter from the bed on your strong wings and stand beside the bed
>"Excellent work thus far, my little sentry. I think we'll try a few dialogue exercises in a little while."
>You nod and settle in for the night ahead
>Anonymous is a complicated human, but this is a complicated place
>"Now, repeat after me... Stop! You've violated the law!..."
"Stop. You've violated..."
>"No, no, from the heart! Stop!"
>The sound of voice training persists into the night

>Day Arson, Murder and Jay Walking in Equestria
>Be Anonymous the Recovering
>After a good night of practicing, you believe Nightlight has gotten the hang of commanding her voice
>It would prove to be an admirable skill in harder times and if she ever finds herself leading other guards
>She learns quickly enough, but you need to start training her body if she is to ever make a proper guard
>You carefully lift yourself up and bend your legs over the edge of the bed
>The pain in your body is fading with each hour and this would not be your first time experiencing healing magic
>Though you know it means the backlash this time will be intense
>You will handle the consequences as the come
>An easy movement takes longer than it should with your current wounds as you step towards the sleeping form of your ward
>She is slumped over to one side in a rigid guarding position and you can't help but chuckle at the sight
>You nudge her lightly until her eyes spring open
"Good afternoon. How did you sleep?"
>Nightlight backs up a bit before gawking wildly at you
>"Hey! Get back in bed! You shouldn't be walking around!"
"I am feeling fine..."
>"No, Sir! I am under orders to make sure you get better and that's that!"
>She pushes on your leg and you are forced back a bit
>Not having the patience for her silliness today, you sidestep and watch her fall a few feet forward
"We need to go out today. Lying in bed for two days is simply unheard of for the night watch."
>"But, you're still bleeding! Look at yourself!"
>You hardly notice the blood pushing from the fresh wounds around the gauze squares on your legs and chest
>"You keep getting up and tearing new holes in your body like some kind of crazy pony! Are you trying to kill yourself?!"
>You turn on your heel as quickly as you can with a reprimand on your lips
>Her eyes lock with your own and, for the moment, your words are halted
>A determination burns in her eye the likes of which you have never seen
>"Get in the bed and let me clean you up again! Just... Just lay down for a few hours and get some rest!"
>You heave a bit as your chest grows heavy
>There is still more bleeding than you would care for, but you must face the facts that you're still mortal
"I'll have you know that I am doing this on my own accord..."
>She smirks quickly as you lurch over to the bed and lay down carefully
>Your neck and head ache periodically as you breathe
>Nightlight is at your side in a moment with the med-kit in her mouth
>She retrieves a fresh strip of bandage and looks you over carefully
"What? What is wrong?"
>"You look grimy, Sir..."
>She quickly sniffs the air before turning away from you
>"... And you smell none too clean either, Sir."
"I think I smell fine..."
>She lets out a sigh from a corner of her mouth and rolls her eyes
>You try to sniff at yourself, but find your own particular musk rather pleasing
"Fine... fetch the sponge, sentry!"
>She salutes you with renew vigor and produces a pail of water and a yellow sponge disk
>"As precaution, Sir. I feel it would be best to clean you before apply the new gauze."
>You present your arms first and turn your face from her
>Nothing is more humiliating than needing another to wash you
>The cool feeling begins to spread over your body and you relax a bit as Nightlight tends to your sore muscles
>She cleans down your shoulders and back slowly before moving around your neck and face
>"Is this... does it feel right?"
"Yes, it is fine..."
>"OK, because your face is really twisted right now. Looks like you bit a lemon."
"I hate baths."
>Nightlight stumbles around your body until she is straddling you again
>She takes a newly dipped sponge and presses it to your chest
>The feeling of cool water eases the pain around the bandages and you can't help but loosen up 
>"You look like you're enjoying this, you know? For somep0ny that hates baths?"
>This ward has the sharpest tongue you've ever encountered, you think
>No matter, you are sharper still!
>While she distracts herself on your chest, you scoop a handful of water quickly and hold it just behind her back
"I suppose you are good at what you do... but, personally, I find you..."
>You toss the water over her head and mat her ears with your fingers
"... A little wet behind the ears!"
>She sputters and squeaks while wiping her eyes only to look up and see you grinning widely
>Your little trick seems to anger the mare for a moment, but she calms herself and stares into your face
>"Can I please continue without further interruption, -Sir-?"
"By all means..."
>You spread your arms and lean back, giving the little pony easy access to your body
>She seems to lighten up and even smile while you let her work
>Nightlight wipes down your chest to your belly button and scrubs quickly at your abs
>With another swift movement, she presses just above your tattered shorts
"One moment, dear Nightlight..."
>"What is it now?"
"Ignore that, if you would, you can stop or move to my feet."
>She looks at you sternly again
>"Anonymous, Sir. I was given an order by the Princess of the Night herself. Why do you not want me to follow the simple instructions of being your caretaker?"
"No, not that. You just don't need to bother any lower. For your own good."
>"Oh, fine, I'll just mind my own business and just..."
>You feel a pressure at your waist band and look up to see two eyes leering back at you
>Nightlight's mouth pulls your pants to your knees in one smooth movement
>Her devious grin lowers and fixates on your exposed body before slowly fading
>You feel her mouth leave your pants as she hops back in some mixture of surprise and disgust
>"By Celestia! That's where you were hiding it!"
>She covers her eyes and turns her head away
"I told you not to go any lower. Stubborn 'til the end."
>You smile to her, not really mad with the events
>She peaks from between her hooves at your naked body with a bit more curiosity this time
>"I am not stubborn... I am trying to follow orders..."
"Well, we have come this far. I'll just finish up myself. Why don't you get something to eat?"
>Nightlight slowly crawls back towards you and you watch her actions warily
>"So... So, it looks like that, huh?"
"Yes, have you never been around stallions before?"
>"No... Um, I mean, yes, I have! It just... yours is... it's different."
"Well, yes, I am not a pony..."
>You reach for the sponge only to have Nightlight snatch it up
>"No, it is my duty to care for you in your time of need."
"At ease, Nightlight... My arm is working well enough."
>She looks to you with an odd sort of enthusiasm as she dips the sponge again
"Heh... You really want to do this? Well, let me give you the freedom you seek."
>Nightlight says nothing to you as she approaches your groin
>Her nose twitches at the scent in a wholly different way and she watches you with wide eyes
>You recline and allow her full access now
>Slowly, carefully, she presses the cool sponge against your warm sex and scrubs in a small circle
>After a moment or so, she pushes your male parts around while gingerly cleaning you
>Her eyes glisten and her mouth hangs open as she rolls the sponge over your sack
>You look up quickly and clear your throat when you feel her bouncing your testes a little too fondly
>She blushes and pretends to keep up the bathing farce
"Enjoying the view?"
>"What? No, of course not! This is to, um... be your caretaker! Right."
"I think I am clean enough down there..."
>She suddenly stops and looks up at you
>"Does it... does it get bigger?"
"What kind of question is that?"
>She stares at you a moment longer
"Yes, it gets bigger, but only when I want it to."
>"I've never seen a stallion or human this close before..."
"Why not? You are attractive enough by pony standards. Surely, it would not be difficult."
>Her cheeks glow with an intensity reserved for school children and nobles
>"You think I'm... a-attractive?"
"For a mare, why not? I think it is time you stopped scrubbing there, though. I am starting to chafe..."
>Nightlight removes the sponge and apologizes quickly
"If you could, can you help me pull up my pants?"
>She nods lightly before gripping the loose waistband in her mouth
>Slowly, Nightlight slides up your body backwards
>Her tail whaps your face as she back into you until you feel a snort of hot air pass over your expertly clean member
>A pinch further and you are covered again 
"Thank you, Night..."
>Something warm drips onto your neck from above and your eyes cross to focus
>Above you stands your ward, her little backside slick with moisture
>Her scent is as natural as you remember from other mares, albeit a little sweeter
>Perhaps it is from her highly saccharine diet of fruit?
>You reach up weakly and attempt to push her sturdy flank to one side
>"Oh! Not there! Don't touch me there!"
>Nightlight moves away and huddles her rear leg to her side
"Do you have that sponge still?"
>"Y-yeah, why?"
>You point to the splotch of mare goo on your neck as if runs down your throat and onto your chest
>"Oh... my... I-It's not... I didn't mean it, I swear, Sir."
"Just clean it off and we'll call it even..."
>You cannot believe this mare tonight!
>It is as if she is trying to avoid duty in the pursuit of some frivolous fling
"Is your head clear, Nightlight? Are you feeling up to studying tonight?"
>She looks you over once with a bit of laboured breathing
>"Always, Sir..."
"Then get that look off your face, soldier!"
>"W-What look?"
"That one! That look of desire you have!"
>She covers her muzzles with her hooves with a bit of panic on her face
>"It's not that, Sir! Honestly!"
"You smell like a horny mutt in season..."
>Your words seem to push some unknown button and Nightlight goes weak in the knees
"By the light of the moon... You will be useless tonight."
>She huffs and pants before speaking to you again
>"This is your fault! Why'd you touch me like that?!"
"Do not try to blame me for this. You had to see what my pants were hiding."
>Well... -You- could have... um, well, it's not even like you -could- do anything for me anyways! You're just a human!"
>You cock an eyebrow at the statement
"Consider the following... I am higher rank than you. I am a hero, compared to you. I am tasked with molding you into a perfect soldier for the night watch."
>"Well... I... I... Oh, who am I kidding? My body's burning up..."
"Serves you right for not follow my orders..."
>"I'm sorry, OK?!"
>She seems to shout with a great deal of sincerity at you and you listen in kind
>The air is still for the moment before you begin
"Now, change these bloody gauze..."
>She walks around you with a grimace as she begins the job of cleaning your wounds again
>The smell of blood seems to make her a little sicker than last time, but she toughs it out all the same
>Feeling clean and in new bandages, you give her a glance as if to tell her to approach
>"Do you need anything else, Sir?"
"At ease..."
>She nods once and looks back to you
"How are you feeling?"
>Uncomfortable and irritable... and very sorry."
"Excellent, climb on top of me."
>Her voice squeaks out in surprise
>W-What?"
"You heard me, get a move on."
>She quickly floats up and straddles you as if to apply new bandages again
>Without petty words to get in the way, you grip her small rump with both of your hands and hold her still for the moment
>"What are you..."
"Trust is the most important aspect of a guard, little Nightlight. You must trust your fellow guard with your life. Do you understand this?"
>She nods to you, but her eyes seem unsure
"You have done a wonderful thing for me over the past two days. Soon, I will be healed enough to resume my duties and you will be with me..."
>Your hands glide over her soft, furred butt in smooth circles
"It will be difficult and this is part of life in the guard. Are you ready for it?"
>Her voice is barely above a whisper as she squeaks
>"Yes... S-Sir."
"Will you follow me to the edges of the world if that is your duty?"
>"Y-Yes, Sir."
>You glide past the fringes of her damp sex and probe her gently
"Are you prepared to do as I say?"
>"Y-y-yes..."
"To go where I go?"
>You press your fingers into her slippery folds
>"Oh~... Yes-s."
"To do as I command?"
>You push two fingers deeply into her burning body until your knuckles are slick 
>"Yes, yes, yes!"
"Now, allow me to return some small favour to you..."
>Your fingers slide out and you press down on her insides
>The soaking digits sink back into Nightlight with a twist as she moans lightly
>Her face stares down at you while you work her depths over
>"A-Anon... it's... Ah~! Wonderful..."
>You place your other hand at her backside and grip her tail
>As you lift it up, you see her blush deepen 
>"This is... is weird... uhm~! Don't stop..."
>Her body begins to rock backwards into your hand and her tongue lulls to one side
>The warm passage greedily sucks your fingers inside with a wet sound, but you are happy to give
>She is narrow, you think, as you slip a third finger into her and her movement grows rigid
>"An-Anon... it's..."
>Your eyes grow soft as she swoons and grinds against you
>It takes a few more shaking pumps of her body to set her off and she collapses onto your sore chest
>Her weight is not too unpleasant, but the welling pool of mare goo squeezing around your fingers leaks unto your once clean pants
>"Anon! Oh, Celestia, that's good! Hold me, tighter! Please!"
>You wrap an arm over her body and grasp her while her backside spasms 
>Another rush of fluid dislodges your fingers from her and the dam breaks like no mare you've seen before
>"So... good... can't... see... straight..."
>Her head sinks beside your own and she pants her hot breath in your face
>Your fingers feel exceptionally cool as the night air graces over them
"I am glad you enjoyed yourself."
>A hoof rests on your chest
>"I am... sorry, really sorry, for what I said earlier."
"Think nothing of it... I had a feeling I could prove you wrong, at any rate."
>You give a smug smile as you run your clean hand down her mane
>"Is this... is this weird? I've never even touched another pony before. Now all this... with a human! Is this your first time with a mare?"
>You turn your face to one side as casually as you can
"Not entirely, no..."
>Nightlight doesn't seem too disheartened by this revelation and presses her nose towards you
>"Did you... did you like whoever it was?"
"Yes, it is fair to say she was lovely..."
>"Wow, this is strange, but kind of neat... how... do you just, like... get on?"
"When my body is healed, I am incredibly flexible."
>"I bet!"
>Nightlight lets out a small giggle before staring down to your pants
>Though her eyes seem to be looking through them to some degree
>"Could I... you know?"
"I am unsure if it would be the best idea for you to do anything."
>"Why is that? I let you touch me."
"I do not want you to feel that you owe me and I am concerned about you becoming too attached. We have a job to do outside of this."
>"At ease, Sir..."
>She smiles a toothy smile at you and you find her impersonation cute
>She slides down your body while staring back up to you until her sharp fangs catch the top of your pants
>With a sultry glide, the little mare disrobes you and lays on your legs
>Her body is easily warmer than any blanket you have and her soft fur feels wonderful on your skin
>You feel warm breath washing over your maleness as Nightlight stairs at it as if torn between touching it or running
>She finally decides to paw at you before her mouth draws closer
>Her lips kiss the very tip and you feel a familiar warmth run up your spine
>Blood pumps through you as she continues to show you her womanly affections 
>Your rod stands proud and ready as a warm, soft muzzle presses against it
>"So, you just... put it in..."
>Nightlight licks her mouth once before opening wide
>The feeling of being taken by velvety lips is welcoming and you relax that much more
>She moves her muzzle over you once and a sharpness glides past your delicate parts
"Nightlight..."
>She looks up at you with the better part of your shaft in her elongated mouth
"Teeth..."
>She smiles around your member before removing you carefully from her sharp maw
>"It's a little bigger than I thought... Um, that's a compliment as well as a descriptor, Sir."
"It is all well and good, I could handle it later..."
>While you speak, the mischievous mare takes a new course of action
>Her obscenely long tongue slithers from her mouth and coils from base to tip
>The feeling of being encased in something warm and damp is fine by you, regardless of how the details play out
>She smiles and squeaks and her tongue contracts around your thick sex
>You can't help but grip the bed as your head spins a little
>"Ith that gooth?"
"Yes, very good..."
>She continues without much prompting from you
>Her tongue tightens and twists with no remorse as the hungry mare has her way
>It takes a lot for you to hold back once or twice as the feeling of being pulled and squeezed covers every inch of you at once
>Your hands wrap around her head and your thumbs press against her ears
>A moan escape you as your rub her ears in short circles and your body thrusts lightly
"Ah~, can't take much more. That is a very practical skill..."
>Her tongue sucks at you roughly as she senses your body's needs and her muzzle nears your sex
>Nightlight's tongue unwinds from you slowly, making sure to wring you of your sense
>With a quick dive, her muzzle surrounds you and sucks deeply
>You have trouble holding back as you grip her head in your large hands and thrust once or twice
>Her muzzle is long enough to handle you without making her choke and you take advantage of the heavenly tongue
>You feel it wrap three times around you and she begins to milk you in short, rough strokes
>Like an animal, you begin to ride her face until her nose is pressed against your crotch
>A sharp grunt from you and one more quick thrust has you unload a few night's of stress into your trainee's mouth
>Nightlight does not seem aware that this would happen and ends up coughing or gagging as she spits you out
>A spurt of your passion plasters her nose and another hits her between the eyes
>She pants a bit as her tongue cleans her mouth of your spunk
>"That was gross, Anon! Why didn't you warn me?"
"I am sorry, I thought you knew?"
>"That was my first time doing anything like this!"
"Then you are a savant..."
>You sigh happily after being drained so well and look down to the mare in your lap
>Everything is peaceful for the moment until the furry form of Nightlight twitches
>"Um, Anon?"
"Yes?"
>"I'm wet again..."
"I'll see what I can do. Bring yourself up here."
>She complies readily with your demand and your find her face to face with you
>You reach in and kiss his quickly on the lips
>"Anon..."
>She leans in for a longer smooch this time
>Your tongue slips into her mouth and plays across her sharp teeth until her tongue completely overpowers you
>It is an odd sort of thing to feel, but you enjoy it all the same
>Breaking the kiss, the two bright eyes stare back at you with need
"Now, turn about..."
>"I don't understand?"
"Turn and put your rump in front of me..."
>"You'd put my... oh goodness... just the thought of that. Where did you learn something like that?"
"Advanced training..."
>You smirk quickly before she catches the joke and finally turns around
"Now, back up just a little... right there. If you could lower yourself just a bit."
>"How much?"
"You'll know when..."
>Her round, plush backside descends on your face until the smell of a willing mare confounds your senses
>"I am not sure about... Oh~! I get it..."
>Your tongue is finally able to reach the little fountain that is Nightlight and you slurp as her without mercy
>A lewd melody plays from her throat as her hips grind away
>You wrap a hand around either thigh to steady her while your tongue slips into her plush body
>It's nice to be this diplomatic in bed and you pick up your pace a bit
>"Oh~, Oh~! This is great... Amazing!"
>The wanton mare grinds your tongue as deeply as it reaches and shows no sign of slowing
>"Oh, right there, lick that spot again!"
>You pull at her nether lips with quick sucks and listen to the delightful noises that flow from her
>"Oh, yeah... close... so close..."
>The world around you grows a few degrees warmer as Nightlight squirts warm mare goo at an alarming rate
>A wild, primal whinny pierces your ears as you teach your mare friend what love is
>She does not move too quickly from your mouth and you take the time to gently lap at her quivering sex
>She coughs up a small laugh as the sensation passes up her spine again and again
>In her throes of passion, you must have been quite loud
>The door is suddenly thrust open and in steps a pair of night watch stallions
>"What's with the screaming? Is everyp0ny all..."
>The pair of stallions looks at the scene across the room with wide eyes
>You have a mare sitting on your face and the smell of sex hangs thick enough to cut with a knife
>"Well, this was certainly nothing... right, Sunshine?"
>"Absolutely false alarm, Autumn..."
>You peak out from under Nightlight and chuckle lightly
>She, on the other hand, is cover her face as best she can and blushing so hard that you would swear her face would be permanently stained
>The two guards scoot away with the most awkward expressions you have ever seen before closing the door behind them
>Nightlight climbs off you and nestles against your left half
>"Um... do you know them?"
"I do..."
>"Do you think they will talk?"
"Well, being a guard is all about keeping secrets from those who need not know. So, yes, we may make some new friends around the garrison."
>You feel a face burrow under your arm
>"Are we going to get in trouble for this?"
"I... I don't actually know."
>A sigh escapes from under you 
"It was odd, actually. I expressed my concerns to Princess Luna at the start when I learned you were a mare. This sort of thing happens and that is why we keep the garrison segregated by gender. She did not seem worried."
>"Oh gosh, do you think Princess Luna will find out."
"The mistress of espionage? Oh yes, she will find out sooner or later. You cannot hide anything from the Princess of the Night."
>"I can't believe you talked me into that!"
>You rest a hand on her belly and slide back and forth slowly
"I am sorry if you did not enjoy it."
>"No, that's not what I mean!"
"So, you did enjoy it?"
>"Yes, but-!"
>You glide your hand around her thigh and grip her little butt lightly
"Butt?"
>"Cut it out..."
>Nightlight looks up at you with eyes that beg for more and you smile wickedly
"Not that I mind, but why did you let me go this far?"
>"I don't know... it just started and then... whatever, right?"
"I suppose that is good enough reason."
>She lays beside you and her breathing is easy
>You pet her side a while longer until the sound of a light snore rises up from Nightlight
>She is sound asleep with a smile on her muzzle and you look at her with a strange mixture of feelings
>Stay distant, you think, there is so much more to do before her time comes to stand on her own
>You whisper to yourself before closing your own eyes
"Sleep tight, Nightlight..."

>Day Arson, Murder and Jay Walking in Equestria
>Be Anonymous the Recovering
>After a good night of practicing, you believe Nightlight has gotten the hang of commanding her voice
>It would prove to be an admirable skill in harder times and if she ever finds herself leading other guards
>She learns quickly enough, but you need to start training her body if she is to ever make a proper guard
>You carefully lift yourself up and bend your legs over the edge of the bed
>The pain in your body is fading with each hour and this would not be your first time experiencing healing magic
>Though you know it means the backlash this time will be intense
>You will handle the consequences as the come
>An easy movement takes longer than it should with your current wounds as you step towards the sleeping form of your ward
>She is slumped over to one side in a rigid guarding position and you can't help but chuckle at the sight
>You nudge her lightly until her eyes spring open
"Good afternoon. How did you sleep?"
>Nightlight backs up a bit before gawking wildly at you
>"Hey! Get back in bed! You shouldn't be walking around!"
"I am feeling fine..."
>"No, Sir! I am under orders to make sure you get better and that's that!"
>She pushes on your leg and you are forced back a bit
>Not having the patience for her silliness today, you sidestep and watch her fall a few feet forward
"We need to go out today. Lying in bed for two days is simply unheard of for the night watch."
>"But, you're still bleeding! Look at yourself!"
>You hardly notice the blood pushing from the fresh wounds around the gauze squares on your legs and chest
>"You keep getting up and tearing new holes in your body like some kind of crazy pony! Are you trying to kill yourself?!"
>You turn on your heel as quickly as you can with a reprimand on your lips
>Her eyes lock with your own and, for the moment, your words are halted
>A determination burns in her eye the likes of which you have never seen
>"Get in the bed and let me clean you up again! Just... Just lay down for a few hours and get some rest!"
>You heave a bit as your chest grows heavy
>There is still more bleeding than you would care for, but you must face the facts that you're still mortal
"I'll have you know that I am doing this on my own accord..."
>She smirks quickly as you lurch over to the bed and lay down carefully
>Your neck and head ache periodically as you breathe
>Nightlight is at your side in a moment with the med-kit in her mouth
>She retrieves a fresh strip of bandage and looks you over carefully
"What? What is wrong?"
>"You look grimy, Sir..."
>She quickly sniffs the air before turning away from you
>"... And you smell none too clean either, Sir."
"I think I smell fine..."
>She lets out a sigh from a corner of her mouth and rolls her eyes
>You try to sniff at yourself, but find your own particular musk rather pleasing
"Fine... fetch the sponge, sentry!"
>She salutes you with renew vigor and produces a pail of water and a yellow sponge disk
>"As precaution, Sir. I feel it would be best to clean you before apply the new gauze."
>You present your arms first and turn your face from her
>Nothing is more humiliating than needing another to wash you
>The cool feeling begins to spread over your body and you relax a bit as Nightlight tends to your sore muscles
>She cleans down your shoulders and back slowly before moving around your neck and face
>"Is this... does it feel right?"
"Yes, it is fine..."
>"OK, because your face is really twisted right now. Looks like you bit a lemon."
"I hate baths."
>Nightlight stumbles around your body until she is straddling you again
>She takes a newly dipped sponge and presses it to your chest
>The feeling of cool water eases the pain around the bandages and you can't help but loosen up 
>"You look like you're enjoying this, you know? For somep0ny that hates baths?"
>This ward has the sharpest tongue you've ever encountered, you think
>No matter, you are sharper still!
>While she distracts herself on your chest, you scoop a handful of water quickly and hold it just behind her back
"I suppose you are good at what you do... but, personally, I find you..."
>You toss the water over her head and mat her ears with your fingers
"... A little wet behind the ears!"
>She sputters and squeaks while wiping her eyes only to look up and see you grinning widely
>Your little trick seems to anger the mare for a moment, but she calms herself and stares into your face
>"Can I please continue without further interruption, -Sir-?"
"By all means..."
>You spread your arms and lean back, giving the little pony easy access to your body
>She seems to lighten up and even smile while you let her work
>Nightlight wipes down your chest to your belly button and scrubs quickly at your abs
>With another swift movement, she presses just above your tattered shorts
"One moment, dear Nightlight..."
>"What is it now?"
"Ignore that, if you would, you can stop or move to my feet."
>She looks at you sternly again
>"Anonymous, Sir. I was given an order by the Princess of the Night herself. Why do you not want me to follow the simple instructions of being your caretaker?"
"No, not that. You just don't need to bother any lower. For your own good."
>"Oh, fine, I'll just mind my own business and just..."
>You feel a pressure at your waist band and look up to see two eyes leering back at you
>Nightlight's mouth pulls your pants to your knees in one smooth movement
>Her devious grin lowers and fixates on your exposed body before slowly fading
>You feel her mouth leave your pants as she hops back in some mixture of surprise and disgust
>"By Celestia! That's where you were hiding it!"
>She covers her eyes and turns her head away
"I told you not to go any lower. Stubborn 'til the end."
>You smile to her, not really mad with the events
>She peaks from between her hooves at your naked body with a bit more curiosity this time
>"I am not stubborn... I am trying to follow orders..."
"Well, we have come this far. I'll just finish up myself. Why don't you get something to eat?"
>Nightlight slowly crawls back towards you and you watch her actions warily
>"So... So, it looks like that, huh?"
"Yes, have you never been around stallions before?"
>"No... Um, I mean, yes, I have! It just... yours is... it's different."
"Well, yes, I am not a pony..."
>You reach for the sponge only to have Nightlight snatch it up
>"No, it is my duty to care for you in your time of need."
"At ease, Nightlight... My arm is working well enough."
>She looks to you with an odd sort of enthusiasm as she dips the sponge again
"Heh... You really want to do this? Well, let me give you the freedom you seek."
>Nightlight says nothing to you as she approaches your groin
>Her nose twitches at the scent in a wholly different way and she watches you with wide eyes
>You recline and allow her full access now
>Slowly, carefully, she presses the cool sponge against your warm sex and scrubs in a small circle
>After a moment or so, she pushes your male parts around while gingerly cleaning you
>Her eyes glisten and her mouth hangs open as she rolls the sponge over your sack
>You look up quickly and clear your throat when you feel her bouncing your testes a little too fondly
>She blushes and pretends to keep up the bathing farce
"Enjoying the view?"
>"What? No, of course not! This is to, um... be your caretaker! Right."
"I think I am clean enough down there..."
>She suddenly stops and looks up at you
>"Does it... does it get bigger?"
"What kind of question is that?"
>She stares at you a moment longer
"Yes, it gets bigger, but only when I want it to."
>"I've never seen a stallion or human this close before..."
"Why not? You are attractive enough by pony standards. Surely, it would not be difficult."
>Her cheeks glow with an intensity reserved for school children and nobles
>"You think I'm... a-attractive?"
"For a mare, why not? I think it is time you stopped scrubbing there, though. I am starting to chafe..."
>Nightlight removes the sponge and apologizes quickly
"If you could, can you help me pull up my pants?"
>She nods lightly before gripping the loose waistband in her mouth
>Slowly, Nightlight slides up your body backwards
>Her tail whaps your face as she back into you until you feel a snort of hot air pass over your expertly clean member
>A pinch further and you are covered again 
"Thank you, Night..."
>Something warm drips onto your neck from above and your eyes cross to focus
>Above you stands your ward, her little backside slick with moisture
>Her scent is as natural as you remember from other mares, albeit a little sweeter
>Perhaps it is from her highly saccharine diet of fruit?
>You reach up weakly and attempt to push her sturdy flank to one side
>"Oh! Not there! Don't touch me there!"
>Nightlight moves away and huddles her rear leg to her side
"Do you have that sponge still?"
>"Y-yeah, why?"
>You point to the splotch of mare goo on your neck as if runs down your throat and onto your chest
>"Oh... my... I-It's not... I didn't mean it, I swear, Sir."
"Just clean it off and we'll call it even..."
>You cannot believe this mare tonight!
>It is as if she is trying to avoid duty in the pursuit of some frivolous fling
"Is your head clear, Nightlight? Are you feeling up to studying tonight?"
>She looks you over once with a bit of laboured breathing
>"Always, Sir..."
"Then get that look off your face, soldier!"
>"W-What look?"
"That one! That look of desire you have!"
>She covers her muzzles with her hooves with a bit of panic on her face
>"It's not that, Sir! Honestly!"
"You smell like a horny mutt in season..."
>Your words seem to push some unknown button and Nightlight goes weak in the knees
"By the light of the moon... You will be useless tonight."
>She huffs and pants before speaking to you again
>"This is your fault! Why'd you touch me like that?!"
"Do not try to blame me for this. You had to see what my pants were hiding."
>Well... -You- could have... um, well, it's not even like you -could- do anything for me anyways! You're just a human!"
>You cock an eyebrow at the statement
"Consider the following... I am higher rank than you. I am a hero, compared to you. I am tasked with molding you into a perfect soldier for the night watch."
>"Well... I... I... Oh, who am I kidding? My body's burning up..."
"Serves you right for not follow my orders..."
>"I'm sorry, OK?!"
>She seems to shout with a great deal of sincerity at you and you listen in kind
>The air is still for the moment before you begin
"Now, change these bloody gauze..."
>She walks around you with a grimace as she begins the job of cleaning your wounds again
>The smell of blood seems to make her a little sicker than last time, but she toughs it out all the same
>Feeling clean and in new bandages, you give her a glance as if to tell her to approach
>"Do you need anything else, Sir?"
"At ease..."
>She nods once and looks back to you
"How are you feeling?"
>Uncomfortable and irritable... and very sorry."
"Excellent, climb on top of me."
>Her voice squeaks out in surprise
>W-What?"
"You heard me, get a move on."
>She quickly floats up and straddles you as if to apply new bandages again
>Without petty words to get in the way, you grip her small rump with both of your hands and hold her still for the moment
>"What are you..."
"Trust is the most important aspect of a guard, little Nightlight. You must trust your fellow guard with your life. Do you understand this?"
>She nods to you, but her eyes seem unsure
"You have done a wonderful thing for me over the past two days. Soon, I will be healed enough to resume my duties and you will be with me..."
>Your hands glide over her soft, furred butt in smooth circles
"It will be difficult and this is part of life in the guard. Are you ready for it?"
>Her voice is barely above a whisper as she squeaks
>"Yes... S-Sir."
"Will you follow me to the edges of the world if that is your duty?"
>"Y-Yes, Sir."
>You glide past the fringes of her damp sex and probe her gently
"Are you prepared to do as I say?"
>"Y-y-yes..."
"To go where I go?"
>You press your fingers into her slippery folds
>"Oh~... Yes-s."
"To do as I command?"
>You push two fingers deeply into her burning body until your knuckles are slick 
>"Yes, yes, yes!"
"Now, allow me to return some small favour to you..."
>Your fingers slide out and you press down on her insides
>The soaking digits sink back into Nightlight with a twist as she moans lightly
>Her face stares down at you while you work her depths over
>"A-Anon... it's... Ah~! Wonderful..."
>You place your other hand at her backside and grip her tail
>As you lift it up, you see her blush deepen 
>"This is... is weird... uhm~! Don't stop..."
>Her body begins to rock backwards into your hand and her tongue lulls to one side
>The warm passage greedily sucks your fingers inside with a wet sound, but you are happy to give
>She is narrow, you think, as you slip a third finger into her and her movement grows rigid
>"An-Anon... it's..."
>Your eyes grow soft as she swoons and grinds against you
>It takes a few more shaking pumps of her body to set her off and she collapses onto your sore chest
>Her weight is not too unpleasant, but the welling pool of mare goo squeezing around your fingers leaks unto your once clean pants
>"Anon! Oh, Celestia, that's good! Hold me, tighter! Please!"
>You wrap an arm over her body and grasp her while her backside spasms 
>Another rush of fluid dislodges your fingers from her and the dam breaks like no mare you've seen before
>"So... good... can't... see... straight..."
>Her head sinks beside your own and she pants her hot breath in your face
>Your fingers feel exceptionally cool as the night air graces over them
"I am glad you enjoyed yourself."
>A hoof rests on your chest
>"I am... sorry, really sorry, for what I said earlier."
"Think nothing of it... I had a feeling I could prove you wrong, at any rate."
>You give a smug smile as you run your clean hand down her mane
>"Is this... is this weird? I've never even touched another pony before. Now all this... with a human! Is this your first time with a mare?"
>You turn your face to one side as casually as you can
"Not entirely, no..."
>Nightlight doesn't seem too disheartened by this revelation and presses her nose towards you
>"Did you... did you like whoever it was?"
"Yes, it is fair to say she was lovely..."
>"Wow, this is strange, but kind of neat... how... do you just, like... get on?"
"When my body is healed, I am incredibly flexible."
>"I bet!"
>Nightlight lets out a small giggle before staring down to your pants
>Though her eyes seem to be looking through them to some degree
>"Could I... you know?"
"I am unsure if it would be the best idea for you to do anything."
>"Why is that? I let you touch me."
"I do not want you to feel that you owe me and I am concerned about you becoming too attached. We have a job to do outside of this."
>"At ease, Sir..."
>She smiles a toothy smile at you and you find her impersonation cute
>She slides down your body while staring back up to you until her sharp fangs catch the top of your pants
>With a sultry glide, the little mare disrobes you and lays on your legs
>Her body is easily warmer than any blanket you have and her soft fur feels wonderful on your skin
>You feel warm breath washing over your maleness as Nightlight stairs at it as if torn between touching it or running
>She finally decides to paw at you before her mouth draws closer
>Her lips kiss the very tip and you feel a familiar warmth run up your spine
>Blood pumps through you as she continues to show you her womanly affections 
>Your rod stands proud and ready as a warm, soft muzzle presses against it
>"So, you just... put it in..."
>Nightlight licks her mouth once before opening wide
>The feeling of being taken by velvety lips is welcoming and you relax that much more
>She moves her muzzle over you once and a sharpness glides past your delicate parts
"Nightlight..."
>She looks up at you with the better part of your shaft in her elongated mouth
"Teeth..."
>She smiles around your member before removing you carefully from her sharp maw
>"It's a little bigger than I thought... Um, that's a compliment as well as a descriptor, Sir."
"It is all well and good, I could handle it later..."

>"Oh~, Oh~! This is great... Amazing!"
>The wanton mare grinds your tongue as deeply as it reaches and shows no sign of slowing
>"Oh, right there, lick that spot again!"
>You pull at her nether lips with quick sucks and listen to the delightful noises that flow from her
>"Oh, yeah... close... so close..."
>The world around you grows a few degrees warmer as Nightlight squirts warm mare goo at an alarming rate
>A wild, primal whinny pierces your ears as you teach your mare friend what love is
>She does not move too quickly from your mouth and you take the time to gently lap at her quivering sex
>She coughs up a small laugh as the sensation passes up her spine again and again
>In her throes of passion, you must have been quite loud
>The door is suddenly thrust open and in steps a pair of night watch stallions
>"What's with the screaming? Is everyp0ny all..."
>The pair of stallions looks at the scene across the room with wide eyes
>You have a mare sitting on your face and the smell of sex hangs thick enough to cut with a knife
>"Well, this was certainly nothing... right, Sunshine?"
>"Absolutely false alarm, Autumn..."
>You peak out from under Nightlight and chuckle lightly
>She, on the other hand, is cover her face as best she can and blushing so hard that you would swear her face would be permanently stained
>The two guards scoot away with the most awkward expressions you have ever seen before closing the door behind them
>Nightlight climbs off you and nestles against your left half
>"Um... do you know them?"
"I do..."
>"Do you think they will talk?"
"Well, being a guard is all about keeping secrets from those who need not know. So, yes, we may make some new friends around the garrison."
>You feel a face burrow under your arm
>"Are we going to get in trouble for this?"
"I... I don't actually know."
>A sigh escapes from under you 
"It was odd, actually. I expressed my concerns to Princess Luna at the start when I learned you were a mare. This sort of thing happens and that is why we keep the garrison segregated by gender. She did not seem worried."
>"Oh gosh, do you think Princess Luna will find out."
"The mistress of espionage? Oh yes, she will find out sooner or later. You cannot hide anything from the Princess of the Night."
>"I can't believe you talked me into that!"
>You rest a hand on her belly and slide back and forth slowly
"I am sorry if you did not enjoy it."
>"No, that's not what I mean!"
"So, you did enjoy it?"
>"Yes, but-!"
>You glide your hand around her thigh and grip her little butt lightly
"Butt?"
>"Cut it out..."
>Nightlight looks up at you with eyes that beg for more and you smile wickedly
"Not that I mind, but why did you let me go this far?"
>"I don't know... it just started and then... whatever, right?"
"I suppose that is good enough reason."
>She lays beside you and her breathing is easy
>You pet her side a while longer until the sound of a light snore rises up from Nightlight
>She is sound asleep with a smile on her muzzle and you look at her with a strange mixture of feelings
>Stay distant, you think, there is so much more to do before her time comes to stand on her own
>You whisper to yourself before closing your own eyes
"Sleep tight, Nightlight..."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Day Near-Sighted Distance Running in Equestria
>Be Nightlight
>You awake in an empty bed to the sound of counting
>Looking around, you find Anon on the floor doing push-ups
"Hey! What do you think you're doing?"
>"Recovering from so many missed days of exercise."
"What about your wounds?"
>Anon hops to his feet before flexing his chest
>"Feeling fine now. I even changed the dressing myself."
>Anon stands tall before you and smiles widely
>"Now that you had a few days to laze about yourself, we should double up on the training missed."
>You salute smartly from your laying position
"Right away, Sir!"
>You twist your bottom around and stand on the springing mattress before hopping to the floor
>"Grab some breakfast and then meet me outside. Do not put on anything heavy."
>Anon walks out into the afternoon sun with nothing but his pants on
>Doesn't matter to you too much as you grab a few apples and an orange 
>You demolish your breakfast in record time and brush your mane out
>There is no reason you should have a rat's nest today if other ponies are going to see you
>Stepping outside feels wonderful after being cooped in the garrison and you stretch your body out
>Anon spots you and slides to your position
>"Alright, Sentry! From now on, every morning, we will meet here and start a morning run, two and a half miles both ways. Understood?"
>He speaks to you as if this is the first time meeting and it makes you feel a little uncomfortable
>"Move out! If I beat you back here, you have to polish my armour."
>You grimace at the punishment, more for what has happened than what it entitles
"Sir, yes, Sir!"
>With that, the two of you set out for a run through the castle grounds
>To Anon's credit, he moves extremely well for somep0ny with only two legs
>You find yourself having to push hard to keep up and some of the jumping obstacles he passes through are hard on you
>Anon makes a wide leap over a ravine and lands with his usual grace
>You slow down a bit, out of concern of the distance, but can't stop yourself from leaping 
>You feel your body fall short and quickly spread your wings to cross the gap
>Landing on the other side, you wipe some sweat from your brow
>Anonymous stops and walks back to your location
>"Did I say you could use your wings in this exercise?!"
>You stare up at him
"N-no, Sir."
>"What did you say, sentry?!"
"No, Sir! No wings, Sir!"
>"Good! Ten push-ups for breaking the rules, go!"
>You drop to your hooves and begin 
>This seems slightly unfair to you as Anon never explicitly told you not to fly
>Ten push-ups go by quickly and you find your shoulders are a little tired
>"Alright, lets get back to running, three miles to go!"
>Anon seems to be filled with unnatural stamina and you try to keep up
>Two miles pass and you are feeling very drained already
>The third mile is a hard push as you hit your limits
>Anon taunts you from a few yards ahead
>"You must really want to shine my gear, sentry!"
>You really don't and put your willpower into every muscle
>Sadly, your will is not as strong as it could be
>Your trainer eventually disappears into the castle again and it takes you several minutes to finally meet back up
"O-K... that was... a good work out..."
>"Stand up straight, soldier! Slouching will get you ten push-ups!"
>You do as commanded and await further instructions
>"Now, tonight's lesson will be one that we will start now and practice every single day from here on."
"That lesson is, Sir?"
>"Tonight, we will practice readying yourself."
>That sounds easy enough, but it always sounds easier when you feel good
>You fetch your armor and stand before Anonymous
>"Now, show me how you would usually dress."
>A quick nod is all you need before you begin 
>First, your chain skirt goes over your back and neck
>Then you add the heavier segment around your neck that holds the chain in place
>You step into your heavy shoes and then carefully slip your helmet onto your head
>"Three minutes..."
"Is that good?"
>Anonymous is quiet for the moment and then gazes through you
>"In three minutes, I have scaled the wall, found my target and eliminated them. By the time you arrived, I have slipped away into the night without so much as a whisper."
>Your stomach knots at his words, but you do not show it
"So, any pointers?"
>"No, your form is fine, but you must move with haste! Now, take off your gear and try it again."
>You do as instructed, slowly increasing your speed with each passing drill
>At about the second hour, you are so tired that your flank hurts when you breathe
>"Better, much better... With a bit more practice, you should have it down in no time!"
"Yay..."
>You squeak a dull kind of squeak as you hang your armor up for the last time
>"This has been an excellent warm up for the week, wouldn't you agree?"
"Yes, Sir..."
>"Good! Now, let us clean you up and get some food. We will take an hour or so to recover and then I would like to start on that armour. Would hate to have you polishing all night."
>He smirks wickedly with you, but you really can't battle him
>Stepping into your room for the night, you sigh and stretch your sore body
>"I will draw your bath if you'd be so kind as to grab me my rations?"
>You nod at the easy task and Anon walks away
>It takes no time to pull up a package of Anon's meat snacks and you grab a few apples for yourself
>You munch on an apple slowly as you await Anon, but don't here the sound of water running
>As you approach the door, a retching noise reverbs off your sensitive ears
>You step into the small bathroom to see Anon laying against the toilet and puking up something yellow and glittery
>He stops for a moment and looks at you with heavy eyes
>"Don't... Don't look.. it's-"
>His cheeks swell and he quickly ducks his face back into the bowl
>You hear a spit and an angry sigh before Anon looks up again
>"Get out... I'll have the bath ready... soon..."
"What's happening? Are you sick?"
>Anon's throat shines a little with a yellow dust and his lips have the same staining ring around them
>It looks like unicorn magic, but something is wrong with the way it is reacting
"Oh Celestia... You can't digest magic, can you?"
>"Astute... as ever..."
>You think about the implications for a moment until the smell of raw energy and the sound of heaving fills the air
"Does this happen often?"
>Anon doesn't lift his face from the toilet this time and speaks in a pained way
>"As often... as... I... need... advanced... medicine..."
>Without his shirt, you watch his lungs rise and fall in deep breaths and his stomach curls tightly into his rib cage
"Does it... hurt?"
>"In a way... you wouldn't... believe..."
>It takes him a few moments, but he does rise up to his full height again
>"Sorry you had to see that. I was... was hoping you wouldn't."
"It's good to know this though. After all, I'm still your caretaker."
>"I don't think you are now that I can stand on my own again."
"What if I still choose to be?"
>Anon freezes and looks at you carefully
>Something about the way he stares at you makes you feel strange
>"I suppose, if you will make it harder for me to -not- accept you help. You may still be my caretaker."
>You smirk from the corner of your mouth 
"You look... tired? Let me make the bath and you go eat your food. I have it prepped on the table by the bed already."
>A large smile crosses your features as Anon seems to comply 
>With some sense of what you are doing, you begin running some warm water and hum to yourself
>You step out to see Anon sitting on the edge of the bed, but his food remains untouched
>All the vomiting must be putting him off and you agree with his actions
>The bath fills up to a little over half and you cut the water
"Anon! The baths ready!"
>He staggers in looking a little strained before disrobing
>You squeak and turn your face from him
>"Hah... this bothers you... now?"
"It doesn't! I... I just never seen you undress yourself."
>He almost laughs, but only a pleased groan escapes him
>He steps in and lays back in the tub until he sinks just below his waist
>"You coming?"
"Um... yeah! Of course..."
>You carefully climb into the tub to find it a bit more cramped than it appeared
"OK, lets get your face cleaned up."
>The sponge disks returns as you begin to scrub Anon clean
>He doesn't protest as much as before and you enjoy your work while you can
>"You did well today... How do your legs feel?"
"Oh, good, a little tired, but not bad."
>"Excellent, we'll be doing it again tomorrow, same time."
>You wash down to Anon's abs and admire the nicely defined muscles
>The soap and water run over his skin in a pleasing way, like watching rain drip down the a slate roof
>"Ah, that feels incredible."
>You look up to him and beam
"Thanks for cooperating tonight."
>"Lets do you next."
>If only out of politeness, you allow Anon to take the sponge from you
>He sits up and draws you closer to his body before rubbing the sponge down your mane
>"What do you think of my spear?"
>You look down between his legs quickly and your eyes open wide in surprise
"Um, are you feeling up to that right now?"
>"What? Of course! Combat is vital to discuss."
"Wait, what?"
>"I asked you what do you think of my weapon? I had one commissioned for you as well so that I may train you to use a spear."
"Oh... I thought... Ha, Ok, yeah. No, no, a spear is fine."
>"Good, do you have any practice in armed combat?"
"Not in the service of guards, no. I got into a good scrap with a timberwolf once."
>"Hmm, do you have any formal weapon training?"
"No, I do not..."
>Anon wrings the sponge over your head and lets the soap and water wash away
>His hands work through your mane and clean you in a way that puts unicorn massage parlors to shame
>Something about the feeling of being touched like this causes your head to spin a bit and you relax in no time
>"There we are, nice and clean."
>You look up at Anon as he begins to run his hands down you flanks and to your bottom
"Thank you... this is a nice bath."
>"No, no, thank you for the assistance."
"Whoa, did you throw up your brain back there? Since when do you -like- when I help you?"
>"I never said I was an easy person to work with. I am usually quite grateful at the end of the day, however."
>Anon scratches at your rump with his dull nails and smoothes the fur down your rear legs
>His hands take your tail next and begin cleaning each strand in his grip
>"We should probably cut your tail shorter."
"What? I like my tail!"
>"It attracts too much dirt and a long tail could prove hazardous. It is an advantage for an enemy."
"How do you figure that?"
>Anon looks you over with a bit of a grin on his face
>"Say, for instance, that I was your assailant. I would simply have to step to your side..."
>He tightly squeezes you by the dock of your tail and lifts it upward
>"... And grab this lovely tail of yours. Now, from this close, it may seem all too easy, however, if you leave it so long, I will have more tail available to grab."
>He doesn't let go after finishing his example
>You fidget a bit, but Anon seems intent on stroking you at the base
"O-Ok, I get it... b-but, it took so-o long to g-grow..."
>Anon's hands tease your sensitive tail stub a while longer
>"We could always bind it. Assuming you do not mind that idea?"
>You hardly listen as Anon's free hand strokes down your neck
"I've n-never done t-that..."
>A squeak erupts from you when you feel Anon's hand grip one side of your butt
"OK... we'll t-try that..."
>"It is not a permanent sort of thing, but I am very good at it..."
>His fingers brush against your sensitive slit and make you quiver with anticipation
>It probes around for a moment and you feel it right at the tip of your warm entrance
>Your tongue traces your lips as you ready to feel something slide into you
>Anon suddenly stands, much to your dismay, and leaves you in the tub with a burning new problem
>You look up to see his maleness pass just inches from your muzzle as he exits the tub
>"Come."
>He grabs a towel and exits the bathroom
>You groan to yourself as you follow him
"I was trying..."
>You stomp out into the cool air and try to maintain your composure
>Anon stands before you with a long, dark purple band in his hand
>"This is the wrap we use. Turn around, please."
>You do as commanded, not entirely sure what to think
>Again you feel Anon's strong hand grip your dock
>It feels so good and you try to calm yourself
>The piece of cloth lays across you back and Anon begins to wrap up your tail
>You feel a little tugging sensation as he begins to fold your long tail in half and ties up the first bundle
>Pull after agonizing pull makes you whine as your body drips down your haunches
>What you wouldn't give for Anonymous to just shove his fingers in you right now
>Time passes and you continue to moan until the last of the binding is placed
>Anon gives it a short tug and you almost lose your balance in bliss
>"There we are, that didn't take too long. Hmm, something seems off..."
>You turn your head and look back at him with a hint of concern before his hand sweeps around and strikes your rump
>It is impossible at that point to suppress a guttural moan and you feel a heavy drip fall from your puffy nethers
>"... Ah, that was the sound I was looking for! How do you feel?"
"S-So hot... Anon, stop teasing me already!"
>"I meant about the tail binding?"
>You are desperate now and lunge backwards into him
>Warm skin rubs against your wet snatch and you moan happily
>"Eager tonight... I would hate to keep a lady waiting."
>Anon lifts your tail easily in its new casing and rubs a finger under your boiling marehood
>You await a finger or two, but are surprised to feel something cool and wet first
"Ah~! That tongue... Oh, Celestia, that tongue!"
>You greedily back up into his face in an effort to feel his warm mouth on your horny lips
"Deeper, please... I need this so bad..."
>His hands spread your backside widely and he works you over like an ice cream treat
>Anon plants one delicious, sloppy kiss after another against your drooling hole without rest and you hump back with as much effort
>Your stomach tightens up a little and your rump tenses, but Anon doesn't slow
>With a grunt and a pop, Anon makes you hit your peak 
>Your mind swims as you twitch and sputter against Anon 
>He continues to suck and drink from you as if you were the last drop of water in the canteen
>Your spazzing body can barely stand as soft lips press hungrily into your slick crevice and a firm tongue cleans your insides
>As your wellspring slows to a trickle, Anon sits up and smiles
>He wipes his face on his arm and looks you over
"Oh... my... Can't breathe..."
>"Glad you enjoyed it. You taste like distilled apple juice... I do so love apple juice."
>You want to say something right now, but your voice is useless
>It takes a few moments, but you eventual get your neck to crane enough to see Anon smiling at you
"Do you... Do you want something? I... I'm your... your caretaker..."
>You pant roughly, but try to look enticing all the same
>"I am not certain, actually. How are you feeling?"
"So good... my skin's on fire."
>"I suppose the next question would be; how much further do you wish to go?"
>Your heart races for a moment and you lust addled mind screams for more without care
"Take me... I want... I want to be your mare... Make me yours."
>Anon is quiet for a moment and the seconds pass by like hours
>You think you may have went too far until you feel something warm pressing into your backside
>His imposing form easily covers your small frame and you swallow both fear and excitement in one swift gulp
>"Is this your first time?"
"Y-yes... but, I want this... I want you..."
>"I'll be gentle. If you want to stop at any time, just say so."
>You're a virgin for the next few seconds and everything seems so surreal 
>The world moves in slow motion as Anon's hands grip your plush butt and you feel his thick sex for the first time
>It's hard to breathe as you anxiously wait 
>With a small push, your old life is taken from you in the most beautiful way imaginable
>Anon rests inside you for the moment as your eyes cross in satisfaction
>He makes some throaty groan that almost sounds like pain before slowly pulling away
>Another push forward jiggles your body as you begin to make love for the first time in your young life
>Nothing matters at that very moment except how good and right a male feels inside
>The heat of you rubbing together ignites the deepest reaches of your body and you boil over with passion
>Every solid thrust makes your spine tingle and your wings spread painfully wide
>You want this feeling to last forever as he works deeper with each hip-shaking pump until you finally feel his waist pressing against you
>He leans over your back and you support his weight easily, even comfortably, as he pistons you for all he's worth
>You throw your head back and meet with his own
>Your enthusiasm knows no bounds as he kisses you strong and deep
>Every inch of flesh that Anon touches burns with aching need and you feel another wet orgasm building at your core
>The kiss breaks as you whinny against your own will and push out sweltering jets of maregasm 
>It feels even more amazing when you realize that Anon is still pound on your body throughout it all
>There is a moment where you blank out and become one with nothingness in your mad quest for sexual enlightenment
>It lasts only so long before your hips ache and remind you of the hot invader spreading you widely
>Anon picks up his pace to a point where the sound of your moist backside echoes loudly in the quiet air until he jerks roughly and drives every inch of his love into you
>The most amazing feeling of hot spunk begins pouring into your body and Anon's hands clench your butt unreasonably tight
>He gives you a short, sharp thrust only to feel another creamy jet force itself into you
>Your belly is absolutely stuffed by the time Anon calms enough to realize how hard he's holding you
"A-Anon..."
>"Shh... Don't speak... I know just what you're thinking."
>He sits still for the moment as your vaginal muscles flex and pulsate around his thick meat
>It takes a few minutes to let him slip from you along with a pint of your combined love
"We... we're going to need to bathe again..."
>"Yes... in the morning..."
>There is no pony, or human, that you would rather have had for your first time than Anon
>You look at him with tired eyes and he smiles
"I think I love you, Anon."
>"I think I can accept that, Night."
"Promise me that when our training is over, we won't be?"
>He rubs your mane and side tenderly before kissing the back of your neck
>"Promise me you won't hate me when our training is over and we'll work something out."
>You don't think you could ever hate Anonymous
>"Oh, and since we got a little carried away, I'll remind you. Tomorrow, armour polishing on both our suits."
>Correction, you don't think you can hate him for any extended period of time
>He kisses your neck once more before lifting himself off you and you turn to him quickly
"Is it alright if we share your bed tonight?"
>He chuckles lightly
>"I'd be offended if you didn't."
>You climb onto Anon's small bed and lay down
>He works his way around you and weaves himself through your legs
>You both smell like sex, sweat and apple and it makes you sigh happily
"Goodnight, Anon."
>"Goodnight, my dear."
>Love is a strange kind of tired

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Day Fed to Wolves in Equestria
>Be Nightlight the Satisfied
>You awake to an empty bed sometime in the afternoon and look around for Anon
>As expected, he is up earlier than you and you are starting to wonder how he creeps out of bed so easily
>Approaching the bathroom, you find the door open and Anon sitting in a half-filled tub
>"Morning, Night. How are you feeling?"
"A little sore in a weird way, but good overall."
>"Yes, well, excellent. We are heading out after breakfast again."
"Yes, Sir!"
>You salute smartly and stand tall
>Your butt aches a bit on either side as you pull your tail in to stand like a guard
>Anon looks at you with a bit of a grin
>"Why don't you climb in with me? I'll clean you up."
>His smile disarms you and you decide a bath cannot hurt
>Climbing in, you find the water to be a little colder than usual
>"It is hot outside today, so I like to enjoy a cool bath before the morning routine."
>That is almost crazy enough to make sense, you think
>Anon washes you down and runs his fingers through your mane casually as he speaks
>"Today, we will be running for half the length..."
>You sigh happily before Anon continues
>"... In our armour."
"What? Isn't that heavy?"
>"Yes, I want you to be able to ready up on my command and take off down the same obstacle course we first travelled."
"Are we going through the jumping areas?"
>"Of course not, I want you to swim the ravine this time before turning around."
>You crane your head over your shoulder and see Anon barely containing himself
>"Alright, alright... yes, do the jumping section as well, but the reduced course only has two areas you will have to jump."
"What if I fall?"
>Anon stops for a moment and his face closes in on your own
>His eyes sternly hold your attention as his hot breath caresses your nose
>"As is the righteous way; I will catch you."
>Anon's overpowering gaze strips you and his very presence seems to both bolster and shake your confidence
>It is as if he has practiced his whole life just to command 
>Without another word, he pulls himself from the tub and walks off
>You breathe suddenly, realizing you haven't been, and steel yourself for the trip ahead
>A guard is the finest soldier and you plan to live above and beyond Anon's expectations
>With renewed vigor and a love for duty that could only come from proper molding, you spring from the cold bath
>Anon is wearing his light undergarments and stands sharply by his armor rack
>"Sentry, what is our duty?"
>You proudly announce in your bravest voice
"To watch and protect the Castle against all her enemies, Sir!"
>"And what do we as night guards value most?"
"Speed and stealth, Sir!"
>"And what is the punishment of those who should disrupt our noble cause?"
"Uncompromised attack, Sir!"
>"Now, prepare yourself, Sentry Nightlight. For the night comes on swift wings!"
>Anon grins and suddenly begins donning his armor with a preternatural speed
>You squeak as Anon is nearly ready and you only have half your gear on
>Without looking to you, he lightly jugs in place with a small rattle of metal and heads out the door
>You fumble around for another moment as you slip on your shoes and helmet and try to catch up
>Exiting your small room finds the day sunny and warm
>Few clouds hang in the sky and you imagine the sun is your best motivation to pick up the pace
>As you begin to run, you make a metallic clatter of tossing a trash can down a flight of stairs
>It makes you wonder how Anon hardly sounds like keys jingling, but you push the thought aside
>You are moving a little slower than yesterday and your sore flanks rub uncomfortably, but your legs feel a little better than before
>The course twists ahead as you push on and you see Anon jogging effortlessly in his gear
>"Don't fall behind again! I'd hate to see you working so hard tonight on shining my gear again!"
>You grit your teeth and dig in your hooves
>Your powerful legs kick off the dirt as you begin charging towards him
>Anon smiles before moving again and you finally manage to keep pace 
>Sweat streams on your face and your chest burns from the exertion, but you don't quit
>You come to a low hurdle and watch as Anon leaps over it in an awkward, two-legged manner
>Without hesitation, you keep your speed and leap clear across before landing with a sound of pots falling to the ground
>"Excellent! Keep it up and you might just make catch me!"
>Anon suddenly speeds away with a previously unseen enthusiasm and your mouth hangs open
>It takes all of your energy to even continue on and you come to the small gap from yesterday
>Anon watches your approach as he effortlessly hops the gap and lands with a soft thud
>He stares away from you into the fading sun as he speaks
>"Fear... doubt... we know not these words..."
>Your legs beat and pull you closer to the edge
>"We are the night watch... we are the silent guardians..."
>The edge approaches and you lower your head with your neck
>With a strong push from your back legs, you kick off the very rim and hurtle through the air
>You straighten your body as you sail across the gap and touch down as neatly as you please on the other end
>Anon doesn't say anything as he turns away to continue running, but you swear you catch a smile on his face
>A puff of dry air slips from your mouth as the heat begins to get to you
>It doesn't take much longer to complete the course now and you find yourself coming closer to Anon's speed
>You stand smartly before your cool and calm teacher and salute
>"I do so love watching you polish my armour."
>You do not give Anon the satisfaction of a reaction
>He quickly drops his smirk and leads you over with a wave of his hand
>Without slowing, he takes you to a clear area with weapon racks lining either wall
>You recognize Anon's spear resting on side and take note of the finally polished blade
>Anon himself must have cleaned the gleaming metal as you do not recall ever polishing weapons 
>"Alright, sentry, today is the first day of weapon handling..."
>Anon sweeps his blade from the wall and spins it in his expert hands
>He twirls the wooden shaft above his head before digging the wooden end into the ground
>A wide smile crosses his features as he looks to you
>"Bring your weapon to the front..."
>You notice your blade is resting behind you on a shorter rack and you quickly retrieve it in your mouth
>Anon points to a white line on the ground
>"Stand at that point."
>Again, you follow the command quickly and await further instruction
>Anon stands across from you on another line and his grip tightens on his spear
>"The first rule of combat is to learn when and where your opponent seeks to strike. If you learn the subtle movements of the enemy, you will learn how best to survive an encounter."
>You watch Anon as he shifts his legs into a wide stance and brings his spear level with his waist
>"Rule one, expect all enemies to act with lethal force."
>He smiles to you and his eyes light up
>"Rule two, act with nothing less than -that-!"
>The wooden stick of the blade suddenly sweeps before you and you awkwardly stumble away in time
>You drop your weapon from your mouth and look up at Anon with scorn
"Hey! You didn't say we were starting!"
>"The enemy will never announce when they are going to kill you, I promise! Now, prepare yourself!"
>Anon moves quickly with the wooden side of his weapon aimed at you
>You scramble for your weapon again as Anon closes the distance
>A swooping noise echoes above you as Anon barely misses your head and you cringe a little
>With a quick spin, Anon is at your side and you feel a stick prod your gut
>You stumble over and attempt to readjust yourself only to see the mad human bearing down on you with a malevolent grin
>"It is imperative that you not lose your footing!"
>You raise your stick in time to stop Anon's from ringing your helmet
>"Excellent work..."
>You smile around the wooden handle
"'Ank 'ou..."
>A quick sweep of Anon's long leg trips you to one side
>"Do not let compliments distract you."
>You growl now as your side aches and your hooves throb
"No fair!"
>"All is fair in love and heavily armoured combat!"
>You look up from your laying position and quickly kick out at Anon's foot
>He jumps over you with incredible grace and slaps your helmet with his hand
>You are momentarily blinded by your own protective gear and doubly frustrated
>Yanking your helmet off, you see a stern looking set of eyes in your space
>"Nightlight... a guard does not take off their gear until their shift is over. Ten push-ups!"
>You look up at Anon with a mixture of fear, anger and sadness as you start 
>He sits beside you with his legs crossed under himself and glares at you
>"I see you really have little experience in fighting... we will correct this, do not worry."
>You do your final push-up before wearily rising to all four hooves
>Anon passes you your helmet and you don it with as much nobility as you can
>"Hmm, it has been a few hours... I think you have earned a small break. Come with me..."
>You slowly plod along to Anon's merry steps and find yourself by a tree in the courtyard
>A basket sits easily on a white blanket in the cool shade and you eye it carefully
"Is this... some kind of test?"
>"Yes, in fact, it is!"
"What is expected from me?"
>"I expect you to sit down and eat, or course."
>Anon flashes a smile before resting beside the basket
>He reaches in and pulls out a few fruits, including your favorite red apple, before taking his glove off
>"Hard to feel anything with these on."
>He chuckles as he retrieves a small loaf of bread next
>You stroll easily to him and sit down on the other side of the basket
>Anon passes you an apple and you take it quickly in your jaws
>It takes little to eat and you find yourself ravenous
>"How are you doing so far?"
>Your body groans, your mouth hurts, your hooves throb painfully, and your head aches lightly as you think
"Feeling great."
>"Excellent, I expected as much! You have a certain look to you when you are determined. I like that..."
>You stop chewing as loudly at the compliment and carefully turn to see Anon
>He removes his helmet slowly and you eye his mane slicked back with sweat and his soft lips smiling lightly at you
>His eyes take on the look you have seen so many nights before and you cannot help but think that Anon is two creatures in one
>On the one side, Anon is strong and fierce and will stop at nothing to have his way
>Than again, he has a charming quality all to his own where he yields just enough for you to get nearer
>It confuses your already pounding head as you finish a third apple
"You move really fast..."
>Anon looks to you with raised eyebrows
>"Not at all, I am one of the slowest guards in the night watch."
>You think Anon is being overly critical about his abilities and shrug
"So, what does that make me?"
>He doesn't speak for a moment as he thinks
>With a wide grin, he closes his eyes and smiles
>"Some form of pony-shaped tortoise..."
>At once, the world is quiet and you hear everything around you
>Your ears ping left to right as a strange sense of unease overtakes the grounds
"Anon... do you hear that?"
>"Hear what?"
"That..."
>Anon listens fully before shaking his head
>"I hear... nothing..."
>His face curls a bit with intensity as you both stand to your feet and put on your armor
>"Quietly, follow my lead."
>You trot as softly as possible with Anon in front as you round a corner
>The entire castle seems to be empty as you move from place to place and your stomach knots up
>You whisper to Anonymous as best you can
"Sir, what is going on? Where is everyp0ny?"
>"I... do not know..."
>You enter the barracks to see two guards slumped to the ground in their posts
>Looking around reveals another hoof-full of guards seemingly asleep in the same manner
>"This reeks of magical foolery."
>Anon suddenly moves with a great speed as something else moves on ahead
>You start a run only to slow down as your armor rattles loudly
>The figure ahead pauses before turning and you catch a glimpse of two glowing blue eyes
>A hood obscures the face as the pony turns and flees towards the castle
>You look around for Anonymous, but he seems to vanish 
>No choices left, you decide to give chase
>You make enough noise to wake the dead, but not your fellow guards, as you enter a wing of the castle
and see a black cape disappear around a turn
>The sound of hooves beat ahead of your own as you work further and further inside
>You round another corner to find the mysterious being standing idly
"You there! Cease and desists! You are in violation and will be punished to the highest extent of the law if you do not surrender immediately!"
>The figure looks back at you before casting off its hood
>You see a unicorn that looks not unlike you with slightly sharper fangs and a red mane
>She lets go a small laugh that rings in the halls as she begins speaking to you
>"So, it appears they are hiring all sorts of riffraff these days..."
"Who are you and why are you here?"
>"That's really not important to you, why don't you take a nap?"
>The unicorn's horn glows an eerie blue before she aims it at you
>Her mouth opens and you see a blast of air distort with magic
>A sonic wave breaks upon you and tosses you back a few feet with a clatter of metal
>You look up at her as your ears ring, but you do not stay down for long
>"Hmm, you must be used to this high pitched noise... no matter, there's always lightning!"
>Another charging of energy cackles across the room as the unicorn's horn grows with an angry hum
>You cringe as you await the painful discharge
>"Death to the enemy!"
>A voice rings out from behind the unicorn and you see Anonymous with his spear in hand
>He swings quickly at the unicorn and her eyes go wide
>The magical pull fades very quickly as a grey stub flies across the room and lands near you
>A little blood drips from the dismembered horn at your hooves and you back up with a sick feeling in your throat
>The interloper and you stare at the monster in the hall as it smiles a bright smile
>"Foolish creature... what is their to gain in death?"
>"My horn! You cut off my horn!"
>You hear a pained crying in the darkness as the unicorn stumbles more towards you and away from the beast
>"You would have kept it had you not attempted such a stunt."
>You hear the unicorn fall and then the sound of metal stomping on flesh
>A gleaming blade rises quickly, slicing the very air with a swooping noise
>"No, wait! I-I surrender! I...!"
>The last sound you hear is a wet sort of thud in the darkness and your throat dries out
>A metallic step presses lightly forward and your hooves suddenly panic
>You race from the dark hallway, not wanting to see what might be waiting for you
>As you flee, the rattling of your gear wakes the unconscious guards from earlier
>They begin rising, but you pay little attention to them as your mind clouds with terror
>The next few minutes are surreal as you make it to your room and barricade yourself inside
>You strip your armor off and stack it quickly on your rack before you tuck yourself under your bed
>It takes a few minutes, but you catch your breath and try to think about what just happened
>Anon saved you and you should be thankful to him
>You could have died, you know it, and he came to stop the unicorn from hurting you
>The sound of the door opening slowly catches your attention and you freeze in place
>Barely breathing, you listen as the sound of heavy, two legged steps enter and begin to slowly pace around
>The sound comes closer to your bed before fading and you look on either side to see where they are
>Your whole bed lifts from the ground to one corner as a tall, armored figure with blood stains on them stares at you
"Oh please, oh please, oh please..."
>You weep lightly as you close your eyes
>"Nightlight... Are you alright?"
>The light, concern sound of Anon's voice rings in your ears and you look up again
>Anon looks casually at your shaking form and his large, soft eyes grip you
"Y-you killed her..."
>"Nightlight... Please..."
"S-she was b-begging... Y-you k-killed her..."
>"She was a threat to the castle..."
>Your chest heaves quickly as you whine like a lost foal
>A hand slowly reaches towards you and you jump in fear as it touches your hoof
>Anon retracts quickly and he wears a depressing expression for the moment
>"Nightlight... I do not think you belong here..."
>You want to argue with Anonymous right now
>You want to tell him he is wrong, that you can do this, that you are stronger than you appear
>Right now, all you can do is cry weakly and huddle into a ball
>"This is life in the guard. We protect our Princesses and her interests."
>The sound of pleading rings in your ears again 
"I-It was so fast..."
>Anon lays the bed back in place and you hear the sound of armor piling on a rack
>"Do not worry about polishing it tonight... You are dismissed, sentry."
>With that, you hear the door close and you find yourself alone
>You spend the next few minutes under the bed until you can steady your legs
>The night air is cooler as you rise to your hooves and you look around
>Anon is certainly gone and his gory armor shines a duller shine than you recall
>A slick, red splatter marks the face and arm and you grimace at the sight
"Anon... how could you..."
>He is probably right, you think 
>What if that unicorn stole something powerful from the castle and threatened the ponies of Canterlot?
>You shake the thought away as a more pressing horror comes to mind
>What if they had endangered the Princess?
>Anonymous may have saved the world tonight
>You feel terribly conflicted as you think about Anon
>It is not fair, you believe, that he could so easily kill somep0ny and act so indifferently
>You think he must have killed others before to be so cold to it all
>It takes a little while, but you manage to leave the room and you begin searching for Anonymous
>Some guards passing by smile and you stop them for an answer
"Hello, sorry, but could I bother you?"
>"Certainly, what's the problem?"
"I am looking for Anonymous. Have you seen him?"
>"Oh, you know Anonymous?"
"Yes, but, do you know where he is?"
>The two begin talking amongst themselves before looking back to you
>"Well, last I saw of him, he was filing a report about a break-in."
>You smile widely
"Great, where is that?"
>"Report filing? Beats me, I saw him leave there with Princess Luna though."
>You tense up a bit at the name
"And then where did he go?"
>Both guards look at you and shrug before one finally speaks
>"Probably with Princess Luna?"
>You scowl and thank them before walking off
>Princess Luna could be anywhere at anytime, but you decide the most likely place would be in or near her bed chambers
>It does not take long to find her quarters, but you sadly find a lack of Princess
>A servant catches your eye and you call to her quickly
"Excuse me! Have you seen the Princess?"
>"Oh, she just left."
"Was she with Guard Anonymous?"
>"Um, I don't know who that is."
"Tall guy, something called a, 'human'? Seen him?"
>"Ohh, yes! He was talking with Princess Luna."
"Great, where are they?"
>"They were heading to the courtyard... I think I overheard them talking about flashlights."
>The servant resumes her duties and you try to figure out the last sentence
>Not too concerned for words, you race off to the courtyard 
>The moonlight easily illuminates the nightscape and you make excellent time 
>Entering the court, you spy Anon and Luna sitting beside each other on a tall hill
>You can make out from there that they are discussing something, but not exactly what it is
>Summoning up all your night guard training, you tip-hoof your way across the field and to the base of the mound
>Again, you listen closely and finally pick something up
>"Dear Princess, I was only doing what I must..."
>"I understand, Anonymous, you are ever valiant."
>Princess Luna rests a hoof over Anon's shoulder
>"Do you know who she was?"
>"We do not, but time will tell what her plans were."
>"Ah, so Princess Celestia is already..."
>"Yes, exactly, my sister never misses an opportunity."
>Anonymous chuckles quickly and you are growing more and more confused
>A loud voice bellows over the still night
>"Dear Nightlight! Why do you insist on spying on us?!"
>You nearly leap from your skin, but do your best to try and speak easily
"Oh, uh, hello! I was just looking for you, Anon."
>He turns slowly and you watch him carefully in the moonlight
>Anon's skin shines almost as much as when he is wet and his soft gaze lays calmly on him
>It is disconcerting, you think
"I... I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry."
>"For what?"
"For um... For... being afraid?"
>You hear a deflated sigh from Anon as he looks to Luna
>The Princess turns her attention to you and smiles lightly
>"Fear is a universal constant, dear Nightlight. Sometimes, a pony has to face these fears. I see you are uneasy this night and I am worried about you."
"Do not worry about me, Princess. I am fine! Really!"
>"But, you are not. I can see that deep within you is doubt."
"No, no, I love this! Please do not kick me out of the night watch, Princess! I will get better."
>Luna looks to you with a quizzical stare and then to Anonymous
>Anonymous just shrugs in turn before the Princess returns her gaze on you
>"Little Nightlight, I am not going to make you leave. You have barely even begun training! No, the doubt I see in you is for your mentor."
>You do not answer out of fear that Luna is correct
>"Is it true, Nightlight? Do I scare you?"
>You cannot speak as you look at Anon's face
>He looks so much like you remember from the long nights you cared for him
>You walk up the hill slowly until you are in front of Anon
>"I am sorry for today. I did not expect this to happen."
>You continue to look at his face and watch as he grows miserable before you
>Tears well in your eyes as you stagger towards Anon
"I can't wait to train tomorrow, Sir. It's an honor learning from the best."
>You press against Anon's body and hold him as tight as you can
>Tears stream down your face and into his shirt as you press your muzzle against him
>"Nightlight..."
>You feel Anon's hands rest on your back and wrap around your wings as he returns your hug
>Princess Luna looks on with a little smirk playing on her regal muzzle
"I-I like y-you better l-like this..."
>"And I don't like to see you crying."
>You tilt your face up to Anon and see his beautiful eyes through a blurry lens
>His face lowers just a bit and, without care for watchful eyes, you pull his mouth to your own
>You share a quick peck with the Anon you know and care for
>"Oh, my... Anonymous, is there something you did not tell me?"
>Princess Luna smiles a little wider than you think she should
>"It is just..."
"... Love."
>Anon's expression twists into surprise and Luna lets out a soft giggle
>"It is just love?"
"It is just love..."
>Anon turns to look at Luna
>"It is just love."
>Luna titters a bit before covering her mouth with a pearly hoof
>"Well, I suppose this talk was productive! I shall leave you two -alone-."
>Luna turns and begins to walk away 
>She stops for the moment and looks over her shoulder at Anonymous
>"Anonymous, always the martyr..."
>Luna's giggle turns into a laugh as she magically breaks apart into a hundred bats and whisks away into the night
"Hey, Anon..."
>"Yes, Nightlight?"
"Can we... try that again, but slower?"
>He smiles before holding you by the chin and petting one side of your face
>"Sometimes, I wonder about you."
"Will you kiss me or not?"
>"Well, when you put it -that- way."
>You hold each other tight under the bright moon and kiss once more
>The duty of the night watch is a welcome burden so long as you have him
>No more fear or doubt, you think, you love Anonymous

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Day Volley Ball in Equestria
>Be Nightlight
>You awake in a warm bed with a warm, fleshy somep0ny wrapped around your body
>Anon looks so peaceful in his sleep and you wonder what humans dream about
>His breath blows gently on your face as you stare up at him
>He is curled in a rather tight spiral around you as if he was a wall to defend you
>You move your hips slightly and feel a smooth, pleasant jolt inch up your spine
>Looking down, you see Anon's maleness is half inside you
>A smile parts your sleepy face as you try to recall making love with him
>You grind yourself very slowly as you let the fullness in your belly settle
>From the smell of it, you two must have been very pent up!
>Anon stirs suddenly with his eyes half open and he looks down at you
>"Afternoon, Nightlight. Did you sleep well?"
>He yawns with his face turned away from you and then returns to staring into your eyes
"Yeah, but I'm glad to be up now."
>You smile to him and nuzzle into his chest
>He begins to pull back his hips and you catch him
"Wait... Just... a little longer."
>"We have no training tonight."
"Not even exercise?"
>"Well, it would still be good to get in a workout. No reason we should be lazy."
>You smile at Anon before pushing your hips down into him
>His alert body hardens almost instantly in you and your full feeling gets even better
"Would this count... oh~, as a workout?"
>Anon's hands rest on either side of you butt and he squeezes lightly
>"It -could- if you make me sweat."
>A giggle slips from your throat as Anon pulls you closer
"I'm glad I can still be in the guard with you, Anon."
>"The work is difficult, Night, but that is just part of the job."
>Anon rests in your warm body and you feel his heart beat flow through him
"I will work harder, ah~, so hard... I promise, unf~."
>"Do you truly enjoy my company as much as you say?"
>His body smells so much like your own with delicate hints of passion in the mix
>You rub your face into Anon again and roll your tongue against him
"I love being with you. I wasn't sure in the beginning, but you're amazing. I love you, Anonymous. I truly do."
>"I am glad you do. Secretly, I've grown accustomed to you around and it would be very hard for me to part with you now."
"Why does it have to be a secret?"
>Anon slowly pushes his body into you and you twist in delight
>"It must be a secret or my enemy's would have leverage against me."
>He grunts once through his nose as his thick member halts inside you
>The force of his well-defined hips makes your eyes roll back as you enjoy every little sensation
>You are certain no stallion could ever match Anon in length or control as his fingers dig into your bottom
>"Still so wonderfully tight."
>Anon moans into your ear and it makes you shiver
"This is, uh~! This is such a good way to, ah~! Way to wake up..."
>You are at the mercy of your powerful lover now as he lifts you effortlessly
>He lets some of your weight naturally pull you down while he pushes back up
>You resign yourself to being used by Anon as you look into his eyes
>They are such magnificent orbs, so bright and full of energy
>Just seeing them makes you feel safe and warm
>You are snapped from your daydreaming as Anon sinks another inch into you
>It is hard to believe that anything could feel so incredible and your hooves tense up
>A small, wet sound squeaks from you as Anon begins to pick up the pace
>You can fee the tightening in your stomach with thrust as your own needs are filled over and over
>You squeak a sharp squeak as Anon makes your body spill warm girl-goo 
>The feeling is exquisite and you ride out the continued pounding Anon administers
>Breathlessly, you whisper to your focused lover
"I love you, Anon."
>You feel two solid thrusts before Anon loses his pace and stiffens up
>Fingers clench your rump tightly as a hot load of stallion batter begins to fill you
>It is an intoxicating feeling to have somep0ny spill their frustration into your body
>It is made all the better to have somep0ny you love doing it!
>Anon collapses beside you with a rough panting sound as he unloads
>You hold him tightly so that you get every drop of his love 
>A thought crosses your mind if you could get pregnant from this, but it is pushed aside by a warm mouth pressing into your muzzle
>"What a lovely way to start the night, wouldn't you agree?"
>The forceful spurting fades inside of you as Anon finishes up and you smile
"Absolutely."
>You lay against Anon's muscular body and huff softly between tired coos
>He smells so beastly, you think, like the musk of an alpha timberwolf and your nose can barely get enough of the scent
>A hand wraps behind your mane and nimble fingers run smooth nails against the lining of your ear
>It tickles, but you let Anon have his fun
>"Did you have any plans tonight?"
"No, actually. I did not know we were on rest today."
>"We should find someway to entertain ourselves then. Even night guards need time to clear their head's."
>If only it were so easy, you dream
>You cuddle closer to the lovely body before you and stare up
>Without warning, the door bursts open and in steps a familiar pair of guards
>"Sir Anonymous! We have news from the..."
>The two look at your fused forms before turning away in mild disgust
>"We have news from the, uhh... the Princess... Yeah..."
>The other guard looks back to you and his ear twitches a bit
>"Princess Luna and Princess Celestia would like to see you, Anonymous."
>The first guard ducks his head and whispers rather loudly to his friend
>"Psst, Sunshine... should we just... walk away?"
>The other guard looks to him with a scowl and speaks lowly
>"No, no! We need to give him the letter!"
>"But, just look at what we're dealing with here!"
>You feel Anon stir and slip himself from you
>It takes everything you have not to moan and you try to cover your embarrassment with the thin blankets
>Anon wraps a towel around his waist and stands proudly and dignified, as Anon is want to do
>"Thank you two for informing me. Alert the Princesses that I shall arrive within the hour!"
>He holds his hand out and one of the guards carefully places a letter in it
>They make haste to get out of the room while another snickers at the absurdity of it all
>Anon reads silently before turning to you with an odd expression
>"I have to go..."
"Can I come with you?"
>"I do not think it would be wise for your sake."
"But, I am your trainee! How am I suppose to learn my duties if I do not follow?"
>"This may be above you... However, if you truly insist on going then let us clean up."
>Anon begins running a bath without much speaking between you as you ready his clothing alongside your own
>You muse over Anon's simple white shirt and dark pants as you neatly place them to one side
>His braided hemp belt hangs from one bedpost and you lay a package of dried meat next to the outfit
>You are sure Anon would be hungry after last night and this morning
>A smile breaks over your face as you think about being in his arms 
>"Nightlight! The bath is ready!"
>You trot easily to the bathing room and see Anon stripped down
>It is truly a shame that he would wear clothing all the time with such a cute rump
>He hops into the tub with his usual grace and you follow closely
>The bathing routine is just that as Anon quickly washes you down and cleans himself
>This could be more fun under different circumstances, you think
>It feels like it ends nearly as quickly as it began when Anon steps from the tub and buffs himself out
>You stand to your hooves and shake lightly to wring out the deeper wetness under your coat before drying your mane
>The binding on your tail has held up admirably over the last few adventures you've had and even bathing does not appear to make it come loose
>Anon is dressed in seconds and waits with a slightly impatient gaze
"Just a moment, I would like to brush my mane out. No reason to see the princesses looking like a mop, right?"
>"... I suppose."
>Anon turns the letter in his hands a few times while you properly comb your mane
>Without much ceremony, you are off
>The warm night is rather lively with insects and you hear the chirp of crickets or the buzz of flies as you walk through the grounds
>Anon licks his teeth with a popping noise and you look up
>His sharp canines gleam in the dim light and you are reminded of Thirsters again
"Anon?"
>"Yes, Nightlight?"
"Do you eat bugs?"
>"Not unless I must. Usually, I find the shells too noisy."
"Interesting, so you really can eat anything?"
>"I can, yes. Why do you ask?"
"No reason, it's just interesting to learn things about you."
>Anon is silent for a few steps before he speaks ahead of himself
>"I do not believe I really know much about you, actually."
"Oh... Well, what would you like to know?"
>"Anything you feel that you should tell me."
>Anon continues walking at his brisk pace while you dream up something interesting to say
"I have two brothers and a sister. I'm the youngest of the four."
>"Are they also in the guard?"
"No, my first brother doesn't live in Canterlot anymore. He moved away to Mustangia a while ago. His name is, 'Moonstone' and I am not even sure what he does anymore. My second brother's named, 'Diamond Hoof' and he works breaking rocks in the quarry outside of Ponyville."
>Anon smiles slightly in the darkness
>"Excellent to hear. The beautiful castle you see before you is built and maintained via mined and crushed stones. What of your sister?"
"Oh, my older sister is so cool. She's a stunt flyer in Las Pegasus named, 'Moon Dancer'. Ever hear of her?"
>"No, sorry... I have never been there."
>You think for the moment
"We should go see her show in time. It would be so much fun and I am sure she'd like you!"
>Anon's face shows no emotions and his eyes seem to tense up 
>"Yes, it would be fun..."
>He suddenly stops before a wide set of doors being guarded by two heavily geared soldiers
>They look at Anonymous with a nervous sort of stare before he shows them the paper
>It is an odd transaction with nop0ny speaking and you imagine this is not the first time Anon has done this
>The doors open and the guards move aside to allow you entrance
>You begin ascending the winding staircase, the only sound being your hooves tapping against the stone floor
>Anon suddenly speaks to you in a rather dry way
>"How old are you, Nightlight?"
"Hmm? Oh, three years. My birthday is the second week of Harvest."
>Anon eases up and smirks a little
>"You must be the youngest guard I have ever seen. It does explain a fair amount though."
>You lower your brow and look sharply to him
"What's that mean?"
>"You have a fiery attitude and seem to need to establish your place. It is common in youth and everyp0ny grows out of it... eventually."
>You walk and gather your thoughts about what Anon said
>Banter is exchanged for a few more steps until you finally come upon the doors leading into the tower
>Anon pushes them aside slowly and they creak irritably under their own weight
>You peer into the dimly lit room, but see nothing much to speak of
>Anon steps in first and you follow closely at his heels
>As you walk the path, torches flicker on and illuminate the space you leave
>Anon stops before a small table or what you believe is a table
>There is a white sheet over it and a pony-shaped figure beneath
>An odd sensation of curiosity and horror churn in your gut as you look on
>The torches from behind you burn out as a massive gust of wind tears through the room
>In an instant, you see Princess Celestia standing on the opposite end of the table
>Her large eyes glow wildly in the dark space and you cringe
>Another set of eyes catch your attention as Princess Luna appears in a puff of dark smoke
>Celestia is the first to speak
>"Good evening, Anonymous. I see you have brought a guest?"
>He does not show any sign of warmth as he speaks
>"My latest project, dearest Princess. She will not be a burden, I will assure it."
>"Excellent... Now, onto the matter at hoof. You are a fine butcher, Anonymous. Very easy work to clean up after."
>"Thank you, Princess."
>Celestia's magic draws back the white veil and you see the intruder from yesterday
>Her horn is intact and her body is whole save for a missing gash of fur across the neck
>She seems to be sleeping soundly on the bed with straps around her hooves and some strange device on her horn
>Luna smiles and paces around towards you
>"Commendable as ever, Sir Anonymous. Now, let us find what secrets this one holds."
>Luna's magic glows quickly and a spark fills the air
>It slowly travels towards the sleeping unicorn before gently touching down on her nose
>Her eyes spring to with a startled yelping noise and a bead of sweat collects on her face
>"What a horrible nightma..."
>She sees the figure of Anon and screams loud enough to curdle your blood
>You hop back in fright, but the others simply stare cold and dead into the bound mare
>When the ruckus finally ends, Princess Luna steps up 
>"Good evening! It is our pleasure to make your acquaintance! We ask now of thy name and master!"
>The voice of the Princess of the Night booms through the small room and your ears ring a little
>The mare on the table struggles and tries to focus her magic, but the thing on her horn seems to diffuse a spell before it even begins
>"I won't tell you my name, False Princesses!"
>The term is odd to you, but Anon seems to grind his jaw at it
>"Another from the Cult of the Thorn, I take it."
>He quickly grabs the pony by her mane and yanks her head to one side
>She lets out a small cry of pain and Anon uses his free hand to part the area between the mare's neck and shoulders
>From this angle, you see an interesting tattoo of three circles connected in a larger circle with a thorn piercing each smaller circle within
>Anon lets go a snort and Celestia follows in his indignation 
>Princess Celestia approaches the unicorn from one side and speaks coolly
>"So, little one, was this an attack on the castle or on our resources?"
>"This was a message that your gates cannot hold you safe forever! Your foul rule will come to an end and the rightful Queen shall take your place!"
>The mare struggles again before Celestia lays a horn on her head
>"Be still, my little pony..."
>A magic radiates into the mad pony
>Her eyes roll in their sockets as her shriek fills the still air
>Your ears ring slightly as the world grows silent and you see the traitorous mare breathing heavily
>Celestia smirks quickly before speaking to the sedated creature
>âNow, tell us your name.â
>âIâ¦ I amâ¦ Rosewoodâ¦ â
>Rosewood strains as if trying to hold herself back
>âAnd, little Rosewood, what do you want of Canterlot?â
>âF-f-foodâ¦ starvingâ¦ all of u-usâ¦â
>Princess Celestia looks to Rosewood with a curious worry
>âThere is no shortage of food, little oneâ¦â
>A manic expression returns to Rosewoodâs face
>âFool! You cannot understand this -pain-! S-so hungry that weâ¦ weâ¦ eat the ratsâ¦â
>You gasp and try to explain
âSheâs a Thirster! She feeds on blood!â
>Celestia seems a little confused, but Princess Luna steps up to help you
>âDearest sister, you have yet to meet the newest breed to come from the Forest. The wind and stars tell me of a young race who is, as our guest has stated, hungry.â
>Princess Celestia muses for the moment before turning to Anon
>âSo long ago did you appear from that dreadful place of infinite wonder with the same -concerning- trait. We did all we could to sate you.â
>Anonymous bows without word, as if to prostrate himself
âMomma told me that Thirsters have been around since she was small. I thought everyp0ny knew?â
>The room is a little more silent than youâd appreciate and you shrink down
>Princess Celestia final lets out a small, smooth laugh
>â Guard Nightlight, I am glad you have such experience. It will be an asset to us all.â
âT-thank you, Princess.â
>Princess Luna strides beside the exhausted Rosewood and glares down to her
>âIs your goal to feed from the ponies of this castle?â
>âN-n-noâ¦ Feed f-fromâ¦ the P-Princessâ¦ Grow stronger!â
>Whatever spell Princess Celestia placed on Rosewood begins to take its toll
>The mare writhes in agony as her mind is forced to relay secrets and you can see sweat running down her muzzle
>Anonymous looks to Luna quickly
>âHmm, if this one dies, we may lose vital informationâ¦ It would be wise to feed her just enough to live.â
>Luna and Anon pass a glance at each other before Luna nods
>âAnonymous, you are a valiant guard and interrogator. What do you propose we do with this mare?â
>âThe cultists have never been afraid to die, this one was. I feel we may get more from her by fulfilling just her most basic needs. Allow a special room for her where she will be under lock, key and guard.â
>The Princess of the Night smirks quickly
>âI take it you will head this investigation yourself.â
>âYes, it will provide valuable experience for my young ward.â
>Anon stands level to Rosewoodâs side as she weeps quietly from the pangs of fatigue
>He thrusts his long, human arm out and holds it before the bond mare
>âRosewood, consider this a sign of goodwill. Do as tasked and you shall have a long life yet.â
>Her face turns from Anonymous with fright before he grips the ponyâs mouth
>You see a finger slide into her muzzle and Rosewoodâs eyes spring open
>The hungry unicorn begins to suck at Anonâs warm finger like a foal to its mother
>Princess Celestia and Luna look on in morbid fascination while you quiver slightly at the implications
>You look at the bound unicornâs face for the first time since arriving and see her features are softer now
>Her eyes hold a distinct blue shine as she is fed by the humanâs blood
>A short tongue occasionally skirts the outside of Anonâs finger with an almost loving gentleness
>Everything about this display feels wrong to you, but you would not turn away from duty
>As if by luck or perhaps the disgusted face youâre making, Princess Celestia calls you to walk with her down the hall
âYour majesty, what can I do for you?â
>âDear Nightlight, you have spent some time in the field now, correct?â
>You begin walking down the stone steps and Celestia closes the doors behind her
>âWhat do you think of Anonymous?â
âHeâs a great teacher and an amazing fighter. I am very fortunate to be under his care.â
>ââ¦ And the sex?â
>Your blood freezes in your veins and you can feel the color slipping from your face
âUm, the, uhâ¦ the s-sex?â
>âAnonymous, the Great Ape, the Destroyer, the Devourer, the Knife Before Dawnâ¦ He holds these titles and so much more. To assume he has not taken you by this time would be foolish for one denied of his own kind.â
>You think about it for some time as you slowly walk behind the Princess
>She turns and presses her face into your own
>âOn top of all the obvious reasons Anon would breed you, there is also the matter of you smelling more like him than he does.â
>Celestia smirks at you with sharp, but fair eyes
âIâ¦ I canât compare it. I never made love until I met Anonymousâ¦â
>âPlease do not think I am trying to dissuade you. In fact, I am happy that Anon has found another to share his time with. He is a very strange beast in that he does not understand the full extent of friendship and harmony.â
âBut, those are the building blocks of magic itself?â
>Everyp0ny knows the basic principles of magic and how anyp0ny can harness such forces for works of great good in the world
>âHave you seen the sin of the human yet? He does his best to hide it from prying eyes, but I have witnessed it.â
âYou meanâ¦ when his body rejects magic?â
>âYes, exactly that. Anonymous is deeply afraid of the stigma of magical rejection. To witness the event is to see Anon at his most vulnerable.â
>You recall the night you saw him huddled on the ground with the stain of the Princessâ magic glowing in his throat and on his lips
>âHe can be held to do great things and he is inherently good. Be warned, young Nightlight, for unlike equinity, Anonymous has the ability to cause great chaos as well.â
>Your voice is dry as you rationalize everything
âI-it doesnât matter, Princess. Anon has been so kind to me, he has made me stronger, andâ¦ and I love him.â
>It is difficult to tell these things to somep0ny like Celestia, but you must be heard
>A smile plays across the Sun Princessâ face as she turns to look at you
>âThat is what I wanted to hear. Nop0ny has ever been able to say that, until nowâ¦â
>A cloud of dense fog descends close by and you see Luna step from it
>âSisterâ¦ I am making arrangements for the new, âPrisonâ and Anonymous has fed the prisoner enough to calm her.â
>As if on cue, Anonymous appears as quietly as the night behind your group
>âI cannot say for how long, but Rosewood will be a valuable component. Princess, I believe we may finally have the weapon we need to end this war.â
>A vicious sort of grin crosses Anonâs face before he returns to his usual stoic self
>You trot to him and look up
âIs your finger alright?â
>âYesâ¦â
âLet me see it.â
>Anon holds his hand out to you and you see a small hole with blood around the edges
âWe should clean that up. Who knows where that filthy mareâs mouth has been?â
>âI am fine; we should get some food instead.â
âAs your caretaker, I am not going to let you get some kind of infection because youâre being lazy!â
>âLazy? I have suffered ten times this blood loss without fear.â
âAre you going to make me have to hold you down just to put a bandage on you?â
>You lock eyes with Anon before hearing somep0ny laughing behind you
>Both Anon and you turn to see the Princesses leaning into each other and chuckling
>âDid I not tell you, Sister?â
>Princess Luna covers her face with one hoof as she giggles
>âI had my doubts, but they truly do argue like an old wed couple!â
>Celestia titters with a wide grin on her regal muzzle
>Anon looks to you before sweeping you off your hooves
>The Princesses watch closely as he holds you in his arms
>Your lover sighs before smiling at you
>âYou may bandage my finger, if you really must.â
>As you are carried towards your barrack home, you canât help but feel overjoyed to be held
>The trip is a little slower than usual and you catch Anon staring down to you from time to time
>He finally sums up his thoughts and smiles to you
>"Nightlight, do you think Princess Luna had planned for this to happened?"
"How could she plan for you and me to fall in love? Besides, does it matter when you have such feelings?"
>Anon is silent for a few moments before his walking slows
>He comes to rest under a particularly shady tree and raises you to eye level
>"You are right... I am not sure why I ever had doubt." 
>You quickly cover his mouth with a hoof
"Fear? Doubt? -We- know not these words..."
>A grin parts your lips as you repeat Anon's own words to him
>He stares blankly to you before a smile of his own creeps across his flat muzzle
>"That is correct..."
>He slowly draws you in and you close your eyes
>Warm lips press gently into your own as you wrap your hooves around Anon's neck
>The kiss seems to last forever under that wonderful tree before you pull back to look at your beautiful mate
>Anon is many things to many ponies, but to you, he is just one
>Yours

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Night of the Bygone Tribe in Equestria
>Be Anonymous the Inquisitor
>Today marks the third day of visiting the new prisoner, Rosewood
>As per usual, Nightlight is in tow
>She has grown much more curious of the prisoner and you are happy she is learning
>Nightlight is very intelligent, if she could just overcome her attachments
>You stare down to your trainee
"Protocol, now."
>With that, the green-eyed mare looks up with narrowed eyes and grins through her small fangs
>"The prisoner is not a pony, she is a number to be filed and a tool to be used."
"Perfect..."
>"The prisoner shall be fed twice daily, a meal will be withheld if she is uncooperative."
"Indeed..."
>"And the prisoner is not to be allowed any more books, even if she asks me really nicely."
>You look to Nightlight as her smile wanes a bit
"Absolutely, we do not want a repeat of a the, 'Tree' incident."
>"Who knew her super special talent was using any tree product as a weapon?"
>You smirk and admire Rosewood's will to kill you
>It makes you feel that much more alive to challenge another who would use their full potential against you
>"Did you have to break her legs for that though?"
"It was a learning experience for her..."
>Nightlight giggles with you
>"Oh, Anon, you can be so silly sometimes. The stitches on your hand and head are still not healed, are they?"
"Flesh wound; you are impeccable with a needle and thread."
>"Momma always wanted me to make dresses. At least the skill is handy still!"
>Nightlight chuckles and saunters to your side
>You approach a guarded building with tall, grey walls and elegantly carved steps
>Guards line the walls and stand at posts in the entrance ways with shining armour and glimmering weapons
>You admire them; working diligently, loving their duty for their princesses
>It is what life has always been and what life should always be
>You wave to a guard who allows you entrance with his magic
>The stones turn slowly and grind the earth below as unseen forces allow you to pass
>Nightlight walks ahead of you and merrily steps in time with some mysterious rhythm 
>The music filling the tunnel makes you a bit leery, but you press on
>You are ready this night and have your weapon in your hand along with a woodsman's ax
>No foul magic or foul lumber will hinder your interrogations
>As you enter the antechamber of the prison, the music grows louder
>"This is a good song... Where's it coming from?"
>A stallion comments from his post
>"Number 386 has requested a music box."
>Your face twists in mild annoyance
"Why was I not consulted of this decision?"
>"Oh, um... We didn't think...
>Anon thrust his spear into the face of the guard until the point is within centimeters of the stallion's nose
"You are not paid to -think-. You are paid to follow my orders!"
>A feeling of a small weight presses on your leg and you look down
>"Anon, I am sure it was a mistake."
>"Y-yes, sir! A mistake, sir!"
>You will not have such decisions ruin your hard work
"If this happens again, you will lose half your rations for the remaining week. Am I understood?"
>The stallion nods his head feverishly before returning to his post
>Nightlight and you walk onward to a secluded section of the prison and come upon the chamber of Rosewood
>A stone plank reads, "386" on the cell and the metal door tightly holds against the solid mortar framing
>You grasp the cool handles and turn them slowly until the sound of a hitch and lock unhook
>Opening the door reveals a small, but comfortable bed with Rosewood propped on her side
>"Oh, Anonymous, is it already breakfast?"
>The unicorn smiles with her fangs bared and Nightlight scrunches her nose as she peers in
"386, you know the procedure."
>"I do, I do... But, we're friends now! Surely, I don't need the harness."
"If you wish to eat today, you will willingly enter the device."
>She sighs loudly before hopping from her hooves
>"You are so difficult sometimes, Anon."
>You simply point your finger at the restraints and Rosewood complies
>The device is simple enough, it is a metal board with straps to bind a pony's legs and neck in place
>It is of your own design and you find it is incredible for information gathering, especially if you turn the small handle a few times and increase the pressure on the neck
>As Rosewood slips into the harness, you approach and begin to secure the belts
>"This could be kind of romantic, you know?"
>Nightlight does not take the statement well and you wish she would not feed into the attention
>"Shut up, 386. Your foul, traitorous breath is stinking up the room."
>"Pfft, as if, I clean my fangs, you fruit-sucking mango-biter!"
>"Least I'm not in jail for being a traitor!"
>"At least -I- am not freely serving the False Princess!"
>You finally step in with guttural growl
"Enough!"
>The room is suddenly silent and you catch Nightlight looking away from you
>Rosewood seems a bit pleased with herself, but she generally looks to start trouble
>You bring your finger up to her the hungry unicorn's mouth and stop just inches away
"Before we begin, I am curious to know something."
>You see Rosewood's tongue glossing her lips in anticipation
>"I already told you that I will not say where the Queen is or where our hideout is located."
"I remember that much, but, you have very little choice if I so choose to pursue that question. Instead, I am interested in the topic of your propaganda."
>The mare looks at you with widening eyes
>"Propaganda? We have none to speak of."
"This is where you begin to tell me the truth..."
>You rest a hand on the steely wheel and Rosewood looks apprehensive
>"Propaganda? Ok, um... Well, it is a fact that Celestia is a cruel dictator. Everyp0ny knows she hoards resources and distributes them among the nobles first."
"You are not entirely mistaken, but to think that everyp0ny is not given their fair share from their toils is simply foolish."
>"We toil! We toil in the dark places, we farm and work and strive to live. Where is the so called, 'Princess'?"
"The Princess of the Sun watches the daylight, you are a creature of the night."
>"The other, Luna, has never attended to us either! We are not good enough to earn our place in society?"
"You are foul, barbaric creatures who care only for your own and wish to feast and reap from other ponies. Where do you see yourself in the grand scheme of harmony?"
>"We can be at peace and harmony! We know what magic is, we feel just as any other feels!"
"Yet you make your case by assault the castle and threatening the great nation of Equestria?"
>"No, we seek to bring about an age of a new Queen! The Red Queen! She will lead us and she will say what is and is not!"
>You give the wheel upon the device a slight turn and watch as the belts pull tighter
"Do no raise your voice to me, heretic. To believe that order will be without our beloved Princess is a fool's dream."
>"I-it's not... fair."
>Rosewood chokes under your watch
>It is good to show that you care only so much for the prisoner
>Nightlight seems to enjoy when you gag her, so that is always a plus
>You turn the wheel back and stare at Rosewood
>Her cheeks are red and she breathes heavily while staring furiously back to you
"This was an excellent chat."
>"My meal?"
"Have you earned such things as sustenance?"
>"What? I told you what I know! I told you all truths!"
"I am not certain if they were. Nightlight, would you agree her truths are muddled?"
>"Certainly, Sir. Seems she is a little loopy and I would bet it was from too much blood."
>You hear a snickering sort of sound from Nightlight and Rosewood's mouth arches into utter loathing
>"Please! I am so hungry!"
>You spin around and lunge at the device that suspends the weeping pony
>Your hand wraps around her small throat and you feel the heat of life still beating within her
>Her eyes narrow on you for the moment, but despite her rage, a tear freely falls
"I am your only hope of survival and I am the only one who could set you free. I can just as easily end you here."
>Death is an interesting sort of promise to make, you ponder
>Rosewood's throat swallows around your clenching fist and you feel her words wobble from her
"I... I am sorry... I'll cooperate. P-please..."
>You feel the room grow a degree or so cooler and realize that Nightlight has backed away from you
>She stands a bit to one side of you as you choke Rosewood and you have the strangest feeling that you have upset her again
>You want to explain this is part of the act, that you are not really going to kill this mare
>It would ruin the charade, however, and duty must come first
"Excellent to hear..."
>Your hand slips from her neck and takes on the softer demeanor of feeding time
>You glide your fingers up her chin and rest them on her lips
>Carefully, Rosewood's tongue glides over your digit and she pulls you tenderly towards her awaiting mouth
>A small prick of a sharp fang punctures the new whole and you feel blood drip from you
>At once, Rosewood changes into something more pleasant
>Her eyes soften and round out, her breathing calms, and her body seems to relax
>Nightlight turns her face from you as she hates seeing this
>You are unsure what about this bothers her, but you have vague notions of what it must look like
>While you are simply performing your duties, Nightlight may take it as some form of affection being given to another
>It is hard to say exactly, but she wears her disapproval without shame
>You feed Rosewood for a minute longer until she stops milking your finger with such urgency before pulling it away
>A small popping noise is all that you hear as you do
>The unicorn nay hangs limp and docile on the bindings and you begin to untie her
>It is interesting to find just how a small amount of blood can sate her and you wonder if all Thirsters are like this
>You lift her small frame and lay her on the bed as Nightlight follows closely
>"I... I thank you, Anon. You taste so good... It's really... It's kind of nice."
"Do no get used to it."
>"Will you wait with me here while I fall asleep?"
>This is a shocking question and one not asked before
>Nightlight looks intensely with you, as if trying to plead for you to leave
"It depends... What can you tell me of your numbers?"
>"My people... We're not warlike... We can barely hunt wild game. We're simple farmers most of the time. We have cows we raise and eat. It's just life, you know?"
>You do understand what it is like to crave flesh and blood from time to time
>It must be harder for one such as Rosewood, but you will not give her an inch of charity under these conditions
>It's been harder lately... Livestock started to vanish, we didn't think much of it at first. Sometimes, Timberwolves or Bandersnatches will steal some. Sometimes, they just wise up and escape."
"Has your, 'Queen' been trying to find more food for you?"
>"Yes... I think so... She has told the most dedicated to help look for something to eat. I didn't like the alternative."
>A melancholy expression grips Rosewood's face as you sit down on the bed beside her form
"What was the alternative?"
>Rosewood looks away from you and Nightlight with her hooves clinging to her chest
>"The Queen suggested we raid a nearby settlement. We could take whatever they had and..."
>She is silent for the moment, but you stroke her mane down once with your hand
>Rosewood does not know how to react to the pet at first
>"She said to steal the weak or young..."
>This act of violent pillaging is not unheard of you to you, but to hear that anyp0ny, queen or otherwise, would suggest that makes you concerned
>Nightlight suddenly shouts and you turn your head
>"That's disgusting! How could you listen? That's just horrible!"
"At ease, Sentry..."
>You stare to Nightlight as he eyes fill with tears
>If she cries, you will have to suspend her from these trips
"386, we bid you farewell for now. We shall return later on. Do take care of yourself in the meantime."
>You hurry Nightlight along and seal up the prison once more
>As you leave, all eyes are upon you as the guards follow you carefully
>There has been more rumors going around these days and you wish there was a source that you could impale
>Sadly, it is never so simple
>Nightlight and you exit into the cool air for the second time that night and you stretch out
"I think that went well. If you would, please do not..."
>"Shut up."
>You turn your head with a sharp twist as you stare to Nightlight
"Pardon me?"
>"I need to go get some air..."
>Nightlight walks off in some direction and you watch her leave
>You find it impossible to call her back
>It is strange, you think, that you just don't have the right words for this moment

>On a dusty path under a watchful moon
>Be Nightlight the Wounded
>You storm off from Anonymous as you walk in no particular direction
>Rosewood, the prisoner, makes you furious every time you meet her
>She always says something foul or horrible and she always gets fed despite what Anon says
>You think of Anon again and get even angrier
>You plod on and stomp your hooves into the stone floor with loud thumps
>The combat square appears ahead of you and you hear the clank of metal and whoomp of sticks echoing into the distance
>You ruffle your wings and quickly lift yourself to the sky
>It has been quite a while since you have just flown around, Anon does not fly, so you usually walk
>Tonight, you move on swift beats at a phenomenal speed towards your destination
>Arriving quickly, you see the arena is living with a few guards training either on dummies or with each other
>A few are sparring with incredible hoof to hoof action and others are practicing their stab and slash
>You enter with your head held high and think about partaking in some extracurricular combat when the noise subsides
>As you look around, you see that the other combatants are lowering their weapons or moving further away from you
>You attempt to break the ice
"Hello, everyp0ny! Anyp0ny up for some dueling?"
>Your smile slowly slips away as the other guards mutter amongst themselves
>Finally, a larger mare in beautiful armor approaches you with a scowl
>"You're that one that's with the Destroyer."
"What? Oh, you mean, Anonymous?"
>"Whatever name the Princess has given him doesn't matter. We know what he is and what he does and we all know that you're his."
"What are you saying? I'm not -his-! And I'm a night guard, just like you!"
>The large mare laughs at you before shaking her head
>"Like us? I do not think you realize what it means to be under the Destroyer. You aren't trained like us, you aren't fed like us, and you certainly don't spend time with anyp0ny else."
"I am easily as well trained!"
>"Oh, I don't mean that. The Destroyer won't just teach you to fight, he'll teach you to kill. I don't think anyp0ny here would want to fight you for fear of being crippled."
>You would never hurt your fellow pony, you know this to be true
>"And it is no secret that he's mark you."
>The mare trots around you slowly and you feel a hoof poke at your neck and flank
>"Look at those marks! He's bitten you up like the animal he is and you let him. That's pretty sick."
>A terrible feeling grips you as you listen to the condescending mare
"That's not true! Anon has been the best mentor I have ever had!"
>She lays another hoof on your flank and you get angry
>With a quick and fluid maneuver, you catch the mare by her front leg, flip your wing under her chest and knock her onto her back
>She makes a great thud in the dirt floor and you stand atop as the victor
>The rush of the fighting boils into you and you roar as best you can
>Another guard looks on and runs to one corner while another two shake in place
>Only one steps up to you and it is to ask you to kindly let her friend go
>The large mare stands up again and looks to you
>Her side is bruised and she pants slightly as she talks
>"That's... That's typical..."
"You asked for it! I didn't give you permission to prod me!"
>She spits and looks down upon you
>"Get out of here, Nightlight. You're not welcome to..."
>The mare backs up suddenly from you with fear in her eyes
>You were scowling, but you had no idea you were so scary
>A shadow casts over you quickly and you turn around to see Anonymous
>He wears some grim expression on his face as he looks to you
>"Hello, Nightlight. Are you having fun with these ponies?"
>You nod slightly
>He points to the hurt mare before you
>"Did you cause that?"
>You nod again silently
>"Excellent, she is twice your weight and well over your height."
>The mare grits her teeth and speaks quickly
>"What are you doing here?"
>"I came to find my friend."
>You look up at Anon as the moonlight shimmers off his furless, human skin
>"I want to apologize to you, Nightlight. I have been neglectful as of late."
"N-no, it's fine, Anon. I know it's been hard..."
>You are suddenly gripped and pulled towards him
>"It is far from fine, my dear Nightlight. You are my world."
>You feel your heart thump at his words, but you are still unsure
>These past few days have been stressful and lonely
>As you are pulled to Anon's chest, you have a brief moment of peace wash over you
>This feels so right, you think
"It's alright, Anon, I still love you."
>"I love you as well, Night."
>Anon looks over your shoulder to see some guards still looking on
>"Did you come here to spar?"
"I thought it would help all this tension."
>Anon gently sets you to your hooves and you look to him
>"Would you care to dance with me?"
>A guard rushes outside with an interesting look on his face as Anon removes his sandals
>You nod to him and smile as he raises his hands and balls his fists
>The ground livens up with energy around the arena as a few more guards appear
>You take your stance and announce the start
>Anon leaps from one leg at you as you feint to the left and roll right
>"Excellent, but stay on your hooves..."
>From Anon's fallen position, he spins quickly and sweeps his legs around
>You just barely avoid him as you take flight
>He leaps straight from the ground and catches your hind leg in his hand
>Pulling you to the ground, you land on your back and shake your head
>You move just in time to avoid Anon's foot and kick up with both your hooves
>It sinks squarely into Anon's gut and he falls back for the moment
>The crowd that has gather begins cheering for you and even some for Anon
>Each deft movement from the two of you looks like choreography from a fine play
>It takes a good deal of time, but you two eventually tire down
>Anon's arm sweeps around and clocks you in the side as your front hoof bashes into his shoulder
>Sore and bruised, you both breathe heavily for the moment
>There is a strange hunger in Anon's eye as he closes in
>You swing hard, but Anon catches your hoof and presses his body into you
>With a swift motion, you feel arms entangle around your waist and you are pulled in
>Hot breath washes over your muzzle as two glimmer eyes shine with ferocity in the moonlight
>The fight is concluded as Anon's face pushes into your own and a hot tongue slips between your teeth
>You do not end the tongue wrestling for a few moments as your mind is ravished by lust and your body aches with exhaustion 
>When you do pull apart again, the arena is as silent as when you had entered, but the expressions of other ponies are rather unique
>Whispers fill the crowd as Anon holds you tightly and he tells you again what you love to hear
>A sudden audience member screams out across the barren arena
>"She kissed the Destroyer! Wooh!"
>The cheering starts anew, but in a silly way and you look to Anon
"We should have a bath tonight..."
>"I would love to."
"Carry me?"
>"Just this time."
>As Anon moves, the crowd opens up around him, all the while cheering you on in your victory
>You finally leave the arena and find your way down the stone road towards your home
>"It was a great fight, wouldn't you agree?"
"Oh, yes, definitely... Anon, is it true I am different because of you?"
>"Yes."
>You gaze at him with a furrowed brow
"What kind of answer is that?"
>"The truth. If you want an expanded answer, I will need you to bandage up my finger and repair the stitches at my side."
>You notice Anon's white shirt has a line of red under his arm and you gasp
"I forgot you had stitches there! I am so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
>"It does not hurt, Night."
"You take pain very well..."
>"Correction, I do not feel pain very well. I thank Princess Celestia for that."
"What did she do?"
>"Her magical healing has caused a great deadening of my nerves over the years."
>You stop and think about that for a moment
"Can you feel me when I hug you?"
>"A little... But, that is not important. Being near you brings me this feeling of triumph and that feeling is heavenly."
>Anon stops before the barrack door and opens it slowly
>"You are exceptionally warm, however."
>Stepping in, you feel the coolness of an unattended room and the darkness is so inviting
>You hop from Anon's arms and begin rummaging about for your medical kit
>It looks like you are nearly out of everything and wonder if the medicae ward will give you more
"OK, have a seat on the bed, Anon and take off your shirt."
>He complies in a curiously willing manner and you smile
>His toned body looks so inviting right now, but you have work to do
>You lift the bottle of spray antiseptic and squirt at Anon's finger and side
>A lesser pony would at least wince, Anon just stares blankly with you
>You use a quick adhesive to seal up his finger prick and assess the damage to his sutures
>Two are torn, one could use to be rebound, and you have plenty of thread to work with
"Can you lay on your stomach?"
>Anon simply flops and rolls in place
>You quickly line the needle up in your muzzle and near his body
>He smells like a day of training, mixed with a bit of dust and a hint of his human signature
>You push the delicious scent to one side as you pierce his taut flesh
>It takes you little to pull the skin halves together and you tie the new stitches off with a smart knot
"There you go! Good as new."
>"Thank you, Nightlight..."
>Anon rolls onto his back and your eyes roam over his naked top half
>His muscles glisten with his own perspiration and you see the grooves shine against the dim light
>"You have gotten much better since combat training has begun. I am very pleased with your progress."
>You pack up your kit and look to the lounging form of Anon
"Thanks, you have been a great teacher."
>"So I have been told. Would you like a bath?"
>Your nose traces the smell of the body before you and you lick your lips
"We should get a little dirtier before we clean up."
>Anon smirks and lays his hands behind his head
>"I would agree to such an idea. Do you have anything in particular in mind?"
>You smirk and lick your lips at the meal at your hooves
"I think I'll just -wing- it."
>You unfurl your mighty bat wings and make a lewd gesture with one wing
>Anon looks a little surprised with your display, but you feel really comfortable tonight
>"We have three hours time..."
>He chuckles to you
"Remember that thing you did last time? The thing with your tongue?"
>"Of course, did you really enjoy that so much?"
"Silly Anon, asking questions you already know the answers too."
>You climb onto Anon's body and rest your backside towards him
>As his hands grip you, you ready for the feeling of his loving embrace
>Surprisingly, he opens with a question
>"Nightlight... Did I leave all these marks on you?"
"Yes, I think you were a little rougher last night than usual."
>"I apologize if I had hurt you..."
>You crane your neck back and assure Anon
"If it hurt, I would stop you."
>Anon nods slowly and pets your thighs with his dull nails
>The feeling is so nice that you can only relax your leg
>"You have smelled very different over the last few days. I will freely admit that is drives me a little wild."
>You don't think that you've changed in anyway, at least not in smell
"Not sure, but there's -bigger- things to attend to..."
>You snicker as you ears bounce around and you press your hooves into Anon's pants
>His warmth is inviting and you happily sniff at his scent
>Though he is not particularly furry aside from his mane, he has a few patches of coarse hair around his body
>You sometimes admire the little fuzz and wonder why it is there
>Tonight is not one of those moments, however, and you quickly bring your favorite tool out into the open
>It looks so good tonight with its rigid skin and thick central vein
>You admire the perfect example of maleness in your hooves and decide Anon has waited long enough
>He is the first to grab you and pull you up his body
>You watch his maleness slide from you as your hips snuggly lock around Anon's head and his thick tongue caressing your burning body
>He works enthusiastically on your receptive mare bits as if trying to put out your inner fire with his impossibly wet mouth
>In your throes, you twist in Anon's strong hands and drool onto his stomach
>A sudden, loud rapping sound rings into your dark room and you grow both desperate and irritated
>Anon stops and you feel the amazing tongue recede from you and the body below you shift
>"Are you expecting guests?"
>You shake your head and Anon draws his pants up
>He rushes to the door and casts it open
>You peak your head from around the bed and mutter angry words to yourself
>It better be somep0ny on fire or you'll be so...
>Princess Celestia steps in on gilded hooves and you could slap yourself for almost saying something rude
>"Dearest Princess, what brings you to our humble barracks this late?"
>"I come to speak to you tonight, Anonymous. We have not spoke in a very long time."
>She turns her head to see you on the bed and you are pinned in her large eyes
>"Good evening, Nightlight."
>You nod with a shaky voice
"Evening, Princess."
>You reach for some blankets and wrap it about your waist out of concern
>She probably already has an idea though
>Celestia looks at you for a moment and then to Anonymous
>"Anonymous, may I speak in front of your apprentice?"
>You are taken aback by the idea of the Princess requesting permission from Anon
>"She is sworn to me; what must be said, may."
>Anon closes the door and Celestia sighs to him
>"We are pleased with the progress thus far. Your methods are certainly working and we are curious to see if you need anything else?"
>Anon looks sternly to the Princess and speaks frankly
>"Is that really what you wished to ask me?"
>Celestia turns her nose from him and you swear you see a hint of blush on her face
>"There was another concern of mine. Are you... You probably are. I am sorry for bothering you."
>You have the strangest sense that something peculiar is happening here
>Celestia turns to leave as Anon reaches his hand out
>He grips the side of Celestia and spins her towards him
>You do not know what is happening, but you are deeply concerned
>Anon brings the Princess to him and you realize they stand at about equal heights
>"This is a difficult time, I understand."
>Your lover holds the Princess as if she were a foal and you watch her nuzzle into his shoulder
>"Anonymous..."
>Their faces near each other now and your eyes go wide
"A-Anon... What's going on?"
>Celestia quickly withdraws from his embrace
>"No, Anonymous, you have other duties to attend to... Forgive me, I was acting selfishly. Good evening."
>"It is not your fault..."
>Celestia looks to you again before sulking
>Her lustrous mane does not seem to have the usual shades of magnificence as she walks from the doorway
>As it closes, you look to Anon
>He seems to shiver with some kind of guilt and his eyes look so much gentler now
"What was that about? Did you almost kiss the Princess?"
>"Nightlight, you love me, correct?"
"Yes, without doubt."
>"If I told you that I am not a creature of my own will, would you believe me?"
"I would if that made any sense to me."
>"It is not easy to explain, but know that I am older than I appear and my history is extensive."
>You think about it for the moment and realize you don't know how Anon ages
"Like, what, ten years? I don't mind if you're..."
>"Nightlight, I am 700."
>You look at him with a funny sort of expression
"Is that old for you?"
>Anon simply smiles and holds you tightly
>You must have said the right thing after all!
"Wait, I just thought of something. With how the Princess looked at you, would you have given her a kiss if she asked?"
>"Yes."
"Even with me sitting right here?"
>"Yes, again."
"You're so honest, Anon. It's kind of weird, but I love that about you."
>"I hope this does not strain our personal relationship. The Princess has often used me for a source of relief."
"Whoa, really?"
>"Yes, I have often been required to brush the royal mane for 1.000 strokes or accompany the Princess to bathe."
>You blush as you think about your current baths with Anon
"Have you... Well, this is weird, but, did you and Princess Celestia do -it-?"
>Anon looks to you with a small smile and wide eyes
>"Not once..."
"Oh, well, that is a..."
>"... Yet, she has had me assist her with such activities."
>You look at Anon with a very skeptical grin
"I bet she twisted your tail on that one!"
>You grin and giggle at Anon, though he doesn't return the gesture
>Instead, he suddenly grabs your tail and pulls it up
>You feel your nethers uncover and you twitch a bit
"What are you up to now?"
>"Enjoying the look set on your face."
"I love you, Anon, I don't care if your old or whatever."
>"It is good to be loved by you, Nightlight."
>He kisses your forehead and your ears twitch happily
"Hey, I'm still good to go if you are."
>You whisper to Anon as you stare up his chin
>"Then I must perform to the fullest extent of my ability!"
>Anon lifts you up with great ease and spins you around
"Anon, wait!"
>He freezes in place as he listens
"Don't answer the door until -I- done this time. I thought I was going to explode..."
>"Sometimes, you are very domineering."
"I think you like when I try to take charge."
>Anon bobs his head as his breath brushes against your rump
>"I think you may be correct..."
>Without another comment, you get to feel the lovely, velvety tongue once again
>The night cannot last forever, you know it to be true
>But, love... Love cares not for such simple rules

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Night Bound, Gagged, and Strangely OK in Equestria
>Be Rosewood
>Tonight marks your two week anniversary as a prisoner of war in this dreadful castle
>Sure, you are being fed regularly and perhaps the interrogations have become less severe, but that doesn't make being in a dungeon any better!
>You pace about your small space and mull over some ideas
>It is hard to lie to the creature that walks on two legs
>He is like a dragon, you think, but twice as nasty in his infinite cruelness
>If you survive this, you must inform the Queen that you would have no real weapon against the creature
>From the walls, you hear the guards murmur by day of this mythical creature and at night, you feel its wrath first-hoof
>You are not a fighter by any means and you could not possibly hope to take the beast out
>A nervous laugh rises in your gut as you think that not even an entire squadron of actual warriors would take the creature down, especially if it gets into melee warfare
>No, not a fighter by any means, but you are a fine strategist
>The easiest way to subdue a dragon, you think, is to steal her eggs and ransom them
>While the creature known as, "Anonymous" is mighty, he is not without weakness
>The little mare that trots with him is a young foal and you would bet your left wing that she means something to him
>You think of how she watches in her morbid glee as you are abused by Anon and how she grows frustrated when he feeds you
>Contempt overtakes you as you imagine her grinning face
>Nightlight's fangs are so dull and her coat is so dark; she knows nothing of the pain you suffer
>You do not even really hate her so much as you are envious of her addiction free life
>How different your world would be had you not had these cravings for the lifeblood of others
>It is cruel, you ponder, for a spoiled pony like her to live in this palace and to eat fruit without care
>You would have her fangs removed and her eyes plucked from their sockets and leave her to starve in the darkness like so many of your own
>These angry thoughts muddle your blood and you quickly push them aside
>Anonymous always seems to read your anger and you would not show you were thinking destructive thoughts again
>The time wanes on as you spend time thinking to yourself
>A remorseful feeling takes hold and you yearn for the days before the fighting in your den and before the Queen appeared
>Her gifts came so readily when she first appeared, but like so much in your life, they were short lived pleasures
>"Join the fight", you recall her saying, "You will be a hero, you will avenge the death of your brother", she spoke time and again
>Looking at these four walls and the numerous devices that bind you now, you realize you never should have listened
>Was it the hunger that made you agree or the indignation?
>Even now, you think you could give it all up, but fear what selfish repercussions that would have
>How can you just abandon everyp0ny you know?
>Where would you even go and who would dare support your cause when you are alone?
>Your head hurts from all this time alone and you wish you had somep0ny to preoccupy you
>The shifting of stones picks up in your ears and you hurry to your bed
>The sound of heavy steps comes to rest outside your prison and the metal door begins to open
>In the darkness, you see the silhouette of your captor, but you know it is not the usual hour to feed
"What is this now?"
>Without a word, Anonymous enters you cell with a sharp looking bit of metal on his side
>The other is not present tonight and you grow curious
>"You have been most useful to our cause, but, my Princess fears that your relative information is coming to an end."
>You stutter as you try to steel your nerves
"W-what? I have more to share! I know battle formations and s-secret magics and..."
>"Your services have been much appreciate..."
>The creature draws his sword with speed unlike that of any pony and his teeth gleam off the dim light with a faint blue shine
>He draws near to you slowly, deliberately shuffling towards you until your own terrified hooves pin you in a corner
"This is not fair! I don't want to die!"
>The sound of metal scraping on stone echoes sharply in your ears as Anon drags his metallic weapon across the floor
>"I can smell your fear... I revel in that stench..."
>He lets go a terrible laugh that sends fear into your bowels
>"This is a message that every follower of the Thirsting Queen will hear and -I- will personally deliver it again and again!"
>His voice is no longer that of a living being, but of some deity of death and malice as his face falls in front of your own
>Shaking and barely able to breathe, tears stream down your face and you hold your eyes tightly shut
>You are unsure what death feels like, but it cannot be good
>Hot breathe washes down your face for the moment as Anon speaks again
>"Do you have any last words, Rosewood of the Thorn Cult?"
>You squeak out what you can
"Please, don't do this... I beg you..."
>"Those are the word's of a coward! You have become one with the cult and you should -die- with honour!"
>You cry harder as the intensity of the monster's voice pins you
>This never had to happen, you plead in your head, you just wanted to make the world a better place to live in
>A thought crosses your fear-addled mind as the twisted visage of your executioner smiles down upon you
>Your voice is barely a whisper as you implore the monster to spare you
"I-I'll do anything... T-tell you e-everything... P-P-please?"
>Cold metal presses dangerously close to your throat as Anon begins
>"Why should I trust a traitor? Why should my blood be used one more night to allow a -coward- to live?"
>You wish you could answer these questions, but there is not a single reason to try
"I'll s-serve you..."
>"You do not deserve such glory..."
"Pl-please... I d-don't worship the Red Q-Queen..."
>"Lies! You are marked by her!"
>The blade moves up and presses a little harder into your neck
>You find it hard to swallow as you try to speak
"... Just end me. I do not even c-care about this l-life anymore..."
>You sulk and relax your body as best you can
>Hopefully, he will be merciful and quick
>"I will travel to Agratti and burn your towers and raze your land and slaughter every last stallion, mare, and foal before I rip the heart from your -precious- Queen with my own two hands!"
>He roars in your face and you nearly scream in fright
>Images of your home burning besiege your mind and the fear of death finally subsides as the fear of loss grows greater
"But, the Queen resides at the top of the thorny spire in Aksundi! You don't even have to go to Agratti!"
>A vicious smile parts the darkened face and you feel the blade suddenly move away from you
>Your heart beats in your ears as you breathe harder and confusion takes hold of you
>"Ah, I see... Thank you for explaining that. My maps were sorely incorrect, but I am glad we had this conversation."
"W-what just happened?"
>"I was thinking that the you are enjoying the rack too much lately and I would hate to be considered a bore."
"T-This was all a game to you?"
>"Torture is never a game. No, rather, I enjoy the chase. Oh, we are also freeing you today. I am just waiting for the proper accommodations to be arranged."
>You sit in the corner with tears on your cheeks and bewilderment in your head
"I... I don't understand."
>"We are setting you free, letting you go, sending you off, shipping you out... Do you need more or will that do?"
"No, why are you freeing me?!"
>"Because we do not need anything else from you."
"What if I come back? What if I try to attack the castle again?"
>Anonymous simply laughs as he begins to walk away
>"I had killed you once already, perhaps you will put up a better fight next time?"
"So... So, what am I to do?"
>"I have no clue, actually. The Princess says to allow you to leave. I told her you would surely run home and cry to your Queen and all that, but she said it was only fair. Princess Celestia is exceptionally fair."
"You aren't going to kill me when I walk outside, are you?"
>"Not unless you want me to for some strange reason. Honestly, I have never seen somep0ny so concerned with death. You should probably have that looked at."
>You cannot believe that even being set free was infuriating with this creature
"All that you said about Agratti, you didn't mean it either?"
>"Of course I meant it, however, unless the Princess would have me deliver such genocide, I would not act upon such an idea."
>You quiver as you think about what horror this indifferent monster could unleash and how coldly he speaks of killing innocents
"You are a sick, depraved thing."
>"Not at all... I am a loyal servant. I fulfill my duty and I suspect it is time to go."
>Everything in you tells you not to trust Anonymous, but there is little option
>Without another word, you follow cautiously before he forces you to walk in front
>The guards look at you as you pass and you get the feeling they are almost sorry for you
>Anonymous makes some sound with his throat and everyp0ny in the room takes on a rigid posture
>He is fear made flesh, you think
>How could anyp0ny keep such a beast without an incredibly short leash?
>For the first time in weeks, you find yourself outside in the cool, night air
>The moon looks beautiful as it hangs in the heavens and the clouds swirl lazily as they cling to the sky
>A sense of minor peace washes over you as you continue on
>The tour of the castle grounds ends quickly as you find yourself standing at the front gate
>It is taller than you remember and guards seem to line this area now
>No doubt, they turned out for your dismissal
>You see the wretched Nightlight standing at her post with her ill-fitted armor on and a small lance on her wing
>She looks straight ahead with a very royal way about her
>It is odd seeing her actually performing her duties and not just being a puppet to Anonymous
>Anonymous is the first to break the silence
>"Sentry Nightlight, the key."
>She happily approaches and passes Anonymous some kind of ring that looks not unlike the one on your horn
>A quick tap breaks the enchantment and you feel the ring slide off you
>Your magic surges again and you feel whole for the first time in a long while
>"Raise the gate!"
>On command, the others turn a wooden wheel and you watch the massive frame lift up
>Anonymous looks to you quickly and nods
>"You are hereby released from royal custody and shall be branded a traitor in the eye's of the nation. Further attempts on the castle or her occupants shall be punished to the highest extent of the law."
"I know..."
>You look out of the gate for the moment and think hard about what freedom brings
>There are many paths you can choose, but which is the right path now?
>All eyes are upon you as you stand in the gateway
>"You are slowing down progress, Rosewood."
>Anon looks at you sharply
>You hate him for all that he has done to you and you wish him pain and suffering
>Yet, you find it hard to leave now as you think about the blood you have been guzzling
"I... I do not want to leave. There is nothing outside of my prison door to return to anymore."
>"What of your comrades in Agratti?"
"You know full-well that they are suffering."
>"A coward who will not even share in the pain of her own. It amazes me that you would have come this far at all."
>Anonymous makes a gesture with his hands and Nightlight comes to his side
>The two push you along until the three of you are out of the gate
>You look at the floor as Anon speaks to you
>"I do not know how to pity somep0ny like you. It is not of my nature to be concerned with the weak."
>Nightlight looks at him with a bit of empathy shared for his side and your own
>"Rosewood, the Princess wants you to be free again and that's what we're tying to do here. You can go home and see your family and maybe clear your head a little."
"What home can I call my own when I have sold out my Queen and doomed my fellow ponies?"
>Nightlight cringes at your dark outlook before Anon steps in
>"I am sure that time will heal most of these issues. After the Red Queen has been slain, the Princess of the Moon will more than likely take an interest in your kind."
>For the first time you can recall, Anonymous said something positive to you
"I do not believe you."
>"And I care not for what you believe. I am correct in my knowledge, traitorous whelp."
>You look out into the distance and spy where the Everfree Forest begins
>It is about a day or so travel on hoof from here
>Before you can speak, you hear the high pitched call of somep0ny
>Listening into the dark, you hear wing beats and discover three figures on the horizon approaching on swift wings
>The mare beside Anon suddenly calls to his attention
>"Anon, we have three approaching from the south!"
>Anonymous simply smiles with this turn of events
>"It is as if they knew we would be here..."
>He smiles wider to you in his strange and devilish way until his skin looks tight enough to snap
>You know a fight is coming and you intend to stop your fellow ponies before they are hurt
>Racing off, you hope to meet them further away so that you would have time to explain the situation
>It is of no use as you hear a screech from Nightlight threaten the space
"You foal! Why would you claim this area?!"
>"In the name of the Princess, we will defend these lands from your blood-sucking treachery!"
>The coddled filly smirks to you as if she is pleased with her work
>Her weapon lowers into place and she stares at you with some sort of righteous anger
>You do not want to fight, you just want to get away from everything
>The sound of wings slicing through the air blows your mane back as they soar past you for the oppressive mare
>With an ease and fluidity you know all too well, Nightlight brings her spear around her side and brings it down upon the first flyer
>He screams in pain as he spins to the earth and you cringe at the sound his body makes as he bounces like a stone on water
>You peak up and see Nightlight already back in position, smirking at her achievement all the while
>The two who did not dive for the green-mane mare make the unfortunate mistake to attack the beast
>One winged heroine lunges with a crude spear and misses Anonymous' head by mere inches
>The mistake costs her a wing as Anon expertly hacks into her flesh with his sword
>Red spurts into the air and washes the beast in speckles of warm vitae
>The flying fighter falls from the sky onto her legs and rolls a short distance
>Her screams fill the night sky as her destroyed wing tightens to her side
>She is down and, hopefully, stays out now
>Anon raises his polished blade and it shines against the moonlight with the sorrow he sows as he turns to find the other assailant
>You want to do something, attack somep0ny and save your brethren the pain, but you watch helplessly at this massacre
>The last bat has a bow and quiver filled with arrows and takes his aerial agility to his advantage
>He pulls a bolt and looses it into the creature
>It sticks to Anonymous' chest with a wet thud and another follows in short succession
>Two arrows stand like flagpoles from the frame of Anon, but he remains strangely pleased with the whole situation
>The fluttering aggressor looks a bit surprised, as anyp0ny would at this point, and he prepares a third shot
>Anonymous speaks in some bloodstained voice as he looks to the sky
>"You are not even trying!"
>Anon spins his body around quickly before letting his sword sail horizontally through the sky
>The surprised archer barely escapes the strange attack and pulls back on his bow string
>A third arrow sinks into Anon's shoulder and you see blood begin to run from the holes in his frame
>Nightlight calls to Anon as she approaches him on fleet hooves
>"Are you alright?!"
>You see a little smirk play across the face of the beast as his fingers curl into pounding fists
>"Never better, my dear. Do watch the filth on the ground."
>The young guard turns about to see the mare with the torn wing standing up and scowling
>She charges at her and you make a terrible decision
>With a blink of magic, you appear halfway between both combatants and push all your might into the earth beneath your hooves
>Walls of soil and sod blast through the ground around you and block the two from engaging
>Your chest burns as your breathing is strained from so much effort, but you don't hear the sound of weapons clashing
>With a simple gesture, you dismiss the walls and stare to Nightlight and the injured mare
"This is a losing battle. We do not have the force to stop -it-."
>The injured mare looks up to you with dismay
>"Stop what?"
>You point your head to Anonymous as he allows a fourth bolt to buy itself into his body
>He laughs now and his body twists under the moonlight in surreal ways
>"Death to the enemy!"
>The three of you stand in awe as the beast charged toward the archer with a mad look on his face
>Nightlight seems to be confused as well as she mumbles
>"What does he think he can do right now?"
>As if trying to prove what kind of monster he is, Anon leaps from the ground and jumps high enough to grab the frightened pony's back leg
>They plummet to the ground with Anon on top and the sound of the landing makes the three of you twitch
>The royal guard simply nods her head
>"I didn't know he could jump that high..."
>You turn back to the injured mare and plead with her
"This was a mistake, I am being let go! We need to get you all to safety before that creature loses control."
>The bleeding mare looks at you with fatigue and shock
>"W-what... w-what is that?"
"They call him... 'Anonymous'."
>You watch the silhouette of the beast as he tears an arrow from his own body and stabs it back into the archer
>Another wail of pain grips the sky and shakes your very being as Anon stands to his two legs
>He slowly approaches you and you back up a little as the injure mare does the same
>"And here I was attempting to make peace... You are all such weak creatures."
>You look into the creature's eyes to find them bestial and primitive
>They are small, unfocused orbs that could not possibly see reason if it was spat at him
>"Sentry, kill them all."
>You panic a bit, but Nightlight doesn't move
>Instead, her face is just as scared as your own
>"Sir, we won. They are permanently crippled. They will never fight again, surely, we don't..."
>"That is an order, Sentry..."
>"I... I don't understand why?"
>Anon's face takes on a somber expression
>"Sentry, I am above your rank. There is no need to understand nor think, just act."
>A sound of hooves charging catches your attention as you see the very first attacker run headlong into Anonymous
>His crude spear enters Anon's back and exits the front in one motion
>Out of breath, the stallion smirks at the damage he has inflicted, but you can see the look on Anon's face from where you stand
>The beast's hands snap the spear in half, leaving a sizable chunk still embedded in his body and he turns slowly
>"This is very disappointing. You have come so far, Sentry."
>Nightlight gasps as she looks upon the wounds
>"By Celestia, Anon, you're bleeding everywhere!"
>"And you stand idly by allowing this to continue..."
>Anon spins about so quickly that you hardly have time to warn the stallion behind him
>With instinctual malice, Anonymous lands a horrid blow to the unaware archer
>The stallion screams and falls back on his rump with a piece of broken wood lodged in his eye socket
>As the dust settles, you assess the damage of a mere three minutes
>It is unbelievable, you think, that three fine fighters would be rendered to nothing in moments
>Never have you seen such precise amounts of devastation and you gain a new fear of the word, "War"
"This isn't what I was promised..."
>Anon looks to you with vast indifference
>"You are still free to leave..."
"No, you moronic beast! You don't even care for life! This is -not- what I was promised! I was told that this fight would see us to safety! That we would be fed and life would return to normal!"
>You cannot stand for another moment of pain and you finally cry
>How egotistical you are for crying in front of these wounded soldiers, you consider
"It is all a lie! There is no going back! This -is- life now!"
>You sweep your hoof past the injured, the pained, and the dying until you can no longer balance yourself
"Why are we doing this?"
>"We fight because it is... Our duty?"
>Nightlight seems to be asking Anonymous as she speaks, but he does not respond
>You look to the wounded ponies strewn about the ground and then you look to Anonymous
"Save them..."
>"How?"
"Bring them to the castle!"
>"Helping traitors? I would rather be cleaved in two before such actions."
"If you don't, I'll... I'll kill you myself and proclaim myself the new Destroyer of Canterlot!"
>For the moment, Anonymous just looks at you and you stare back as intensely as you can
>His hand crawls up to his head and he tilts back with a mighty laugh
>"You are serious?! By the light of the moon, I have heard it all!"
>He is about to say something when you take action
>You channel your energy into the ground and quickly pull him into the soil
>To his name, he struggles hard and you cannot manage to pull his body below his waist
>When you finally exhaust all your energy, Anon is stuck partway in the ground and rather displeased
"I will bury you alive in a coffin of dirt! I will suffocate you in the very ground you walk upon! I will..."
>A hoof rests easily on your shoulder and you stop
>Nightlight stands before you with her hoof raised up and you believe she is about to stomp your face in
>You are suddenly pulled into her and she embraces you tightly
>"OK, it's over, you won..."
>Why is she touching you like this?
>Why is she not hurting you?
"G-get off... I'll d-destroy you..."
>"Shh, shh... It is over. We need to get your friends to the Medicae Bay quickly, so keep your strength up."
>Your magic fades and the resentful earth releases the creature from your grasp
>"I did not know you could do that... It will not happen again."
>Nightlight looks to Anonymous with wide eyes as she hugs you
>"Sir, we need to save these ponies."
>"No, we need to..."
>"It is was Celestia would want!"
>A strange look crosses Anonymous' face as Nightlight yells at him and you try to stop sobbing so loudly
>"You ponies and your damned harmony..."
>The mare with the injured wing walks carefully to one side as Anon retrieves the unconscious archer and lancer
>As he lifts them, blood gushes from the shifting wounds around the arrow shafts
>Nightlight slips from you almost as quickly as she set upon you and trots at Anon's side
>"Come on, Rosewood, we'll clean up those scrapes on you too."
>Anon sighs slightly and moans to his apprentice
>"You deliberately disobeyed my orders and now we are saving those who would oppose us. You have made me soft..."
>"Since when do you kill weaklings?"
>A smirk crosses the guard's face as she steps in time with Anon
>"You are far too confident for your own sake, Night, but..."
>"... But, that's why you love me."
>A snort and what would appear to be a smile appears from the creature and you worry for the moment
>"Not while on duty, Night."
>"Yes, Sir."
>It does not take long to reach the gates and Anonymous' sway over the guards allows you entrance without effort
>For somep0ny who was happy to be free, you find yourself in the stony, cold castle walls once more
>You are lead to a wing of the castle you had not previous seen and you take it all in
>The other mare hobbles along in pain and you admire her strength
"Forgive me, I did not get your name."
>The hurt mare looks at you once before resuming her pained plodding
>"My name's Dusk Dancer... Ponies just call me, 'Dee Dee' for short."
"How is your wing?"
>"Not so good... I am starting to get tired from all this blood loss."
>You grimace at the smell of the blood in the air
>Something about another vampire's blood is disgusting and you have always related it to some inherent defense against consuming each other
>It has not always stopped starving ponies in the past, but it is definitely a deterrent
>You are lead into the castle now and find the interior to be bright and surprising comforting
>The first pony to see you gasps and rushes to your group
>"What happened? Were you attacked by the Cultists?"
>Your face stretches in perplexity for the moment and you realize that this pony has no idea who or what the Cultist of the Thorn is
>Anon steps in front of your lot and speaks briskly
>"There was an attack, it was dealt with and now we need medical attention..."
>The nurse looks to Anonymous with a hard scowl
>"Do you... You realize... There's three arrows sticking out of your body and what looks like half a spear."
>"I do... Please, attend to these first."
>Anonymous presents the two under his arm and then gestures to Dee Dee
>You almost don't believe your ears, but the nurse quickly calls a squadron of workers to assist you
>It seems strange as you are not recognized by anyp0ny as something to be feared or abhorred
>The two unconscious ponies are laid in beds and you see a mixture of magical curatives, salves, and bandages being used to restore them
>Dee Dee and yourself are taken to another room where you are greeted by a doctor
>"My, my, that wing is torn up."
>The silent mare unfolds her bloodied wing and grimaces at the pain
>The doctor rolls some type of black film around the wing gently before telling you to turn you head
>"Now, you may feel a bit of pressure, but I assure you that this procedure is harmless."
>A flash lights up the room and the black film shines with a white image inside
>The doctor unrolls is slowly and looks over the picture with a stern expression
>Dee Dee looks on and asks in an exasperated way
>"Can you fix it or not?"
>The doctor smirks charmingly and calmly states that he can
>"It will be a few night's stay though and I can't say it won't be a painful process."
>"Fine."
"Thank you, doctor."
>"Don't thank me yet..."
>The sharp pony quickly heads over to a cold storage locker and produces a bag of chilled, red liquid
>At once, Dee Dee and yourself smell the fine nectar and she looks at you cautiously
>"Please, wait here while I get some equipment."
>He exits the room and your new friend snaps her head toward you while staring in her transfixed manner at the blood
>"Is... That..."
"Qa+... Yeah, smells like it."
>Dusk Dancer looks at you with purely stunned features
>"They just... Just keep it lying around?"
"I had no idea..."
>She quickly paces to the bag and looks at it suspiciously
>"Maybe, this is a trap?"
"I doubt it..."
>That is all you need to say for Dee Dee to grab the bag and sink her teeth into the thin membrane
>Her eyes roll as she drinks in the cool fluid with a lewd slurping sound
>In seconds, the bag is nothing but a flat piece of skin
>"Oh... Oh, I can't believe it... I've never had something so pure."
>She pants roughly as she tries to catch her breath and her eyes roll in their sockets
>"I'm sorry, what's your name, anyways?"
"Rosewood..."
>"-You- are Rosewood?"
"Yes, why? Is something wrong?"
>"You bet your tail it is! We were scouting for the last three days in search of you. We were told that you had been sent to find food in the Everfree Forest and never returned."
"That is odd; the Red Queen specifically sent me to infiltrate this castle..."
>"That doesn't make any sense... You are not in the resistance, are you?"
"I joined two days before coming here."
>You brush your mane aside to show your own mark to her and she frowns
>"Two days before attacking the very fortress of the false Princess?"
"Yes, does that sound odd? I thought we were at war here?"
>"We are... Sort of... There is only a hundred of us right now. They should not have even discussed a siege with anyp0ny yet."
"I don't understand, I was told..."
>A voice suddenly picks up and you see the doctor reenter the room with a few devices you are unsure of
>"Alright, let's get you in bed so I can start this operation. Now, where did that bag go?"
>The full mare beside you hides the empty bag behind her back and cautiously inches away
>"I could have sworn I had one here... Oh, well, excuse me again, ladies."
>He leaves and Dee Dee turns to you
>"Do they know what we do?"
"Only Anonymous knows... It would be best to hide it from the others."
>"That thing; what is he?"
"Some kind of daemon from the pits of Tartarus, no doubt. Nothing in all of equinity could be so ruthless and horrifying."
>"It moved so quickly and fought without fear of dying. I saw the spear impale him and he hardly flinched."
>You shake your head and realize how impossible he was
>His cold demeanor and rugged form makes you think of the peaks of the winter mountains
>They are uninviting, deadly, and too complex to travel safely
>Anonymous had freely given you his blood, nearly removed your head and the head's of several others, and is now allowing you all medical attention
>Truly, he is a complicated beast who enjoys the suffering he brings
"Nightlight, the little pony that fought beside him, she is something to him."
>"A pony can stay near -that-?"
"From what I gather, she trains under him as an apprentice."
>"By the Queen, that's insanity! What kind of life would something like that lead?"
"Whatever it is, it must be cruel and unusual. I am sure that her life is nothing short of being bound and tortured."
 
>In a secluded room with a bleeding human
>Be Nightlight the Hungry
>You sit beside Anonymous as he lays on his side with multiple sharp things jutting from his body like some morbid game of Pin-the-Tail-On-the-Pony
"How are you feeling?"
>"Aching... sore hands... headache... a little hungry. Not unlike my first day of basics."
>You laugh, not so much out of spite, but because this is always his answer
"Well, I suppose this means we will have a few more nights together. I'll get to be your caretaker again."
>You grin your toothy grin at the implications
>"Yes, it is strange how we end up like this."
"What did you do before I got here?"
>"I stayed in this room for a few days until the orderlies could no longer control me and then I would leave."
"Gosh, imagine -you- giving somep0ny trouble. Hardly believe such a thing."
>He smiles to you as a little more blood leaks from his form
"One question, if I could? Why weren't you wearing your full armor?"
>"I had meant to, but I remembered that the prisoner was to be released today and thought not even to bring my spear."
"You throw a sword really well though! I didn't know you could do that."
>"I will teach you a great many things, dear Nightlight."
>You lock eyes with Anon's lying form and stride closer
"I should be more worried about these wounds, but I know you now."
>"Just you being here makes the pain manageable."
>He smiles slyly before turning to his back and resting flatly
>You see more of his blood gush up as he twists about and his shirt is absolutely ruined at this point
>The smell of blood makes your nose sick as you draw nearer to Anon
"I am going to get a bite to eat. Do you want me to bring you some food?"
>"Yes, that would be lovely. Two packets, if you would."
"Oh my, you're starving tonight?"
>"Very much so..."
>Your face hangs just above his and you feel his shallow breathing rising up to your nose
"I'll be back soon. Don't go too far without me."
>You lean in and wrap your mouth around his in a warm, loving kiss
>Even battered, he is still a beautiful thing to behold
>The kiss ends and you find yourself strangely turned-on at the prospect of tending to Anon again
>You think of all the fun you can have while bathing him again
"OK, I need to go for real this time!"
>"Nightlight..."
>You stop at the threshold of the door
"Yes?"
>"I love you... Stay safe."
>A pleasant chill runs up your spine and straight to your brain
>This is the loveliest of loves, you think as you trot off merrily
 
>Be Anonymous the Broken... Again
>Tonight was not your finest night for battle as you assess the damage done to you
>It is not actually painful, but very incontinent as you body becomes sluggish
>You review what went wrong and where you could improve for a similar conflict
>It pains you in your heart to know that Nightlight did not heed your orders in such a tense situation
>You are going to have to carefully train her to follow any instruction and you hope that seeing you so hurt makes her realize her mistakes
>Despite your mild annoyance, the warm kiss on you lips tingles in her absence
>A thought crosses your mind that you are glad to have been standing in front of her
>Had that spear pierced here...
>The strangest sense of fear takes hold of you as you push the though from your head
>Hoof beats begin to reverberate towards your location and you smile
>You turn your head to see the figure of Princess Celestia and you sober up as quickly as you please
"Good evening, Princess."
>"Just look at you, Anonymous... By the sun, what happened?"
>"Routine attack by the cultists, Princess."
>Celestia moves to one side of your bed and rest herself
>She wears a worried look, but you know better than to ask the Princess of her concerns
>"Anon, how are you feeling?"
"Well enough, Princess."
>"I need to ask you a question, Anonymous..."
>You duck your head as your princess speaks to you
>"... When I use my magic to help you heal, do you feel anything?"
"In the moment the healing begins, I do. It feels as if it was a warm blanket being wrapped about my body."
>"What happens as the spell ends?"
>You try not to look at her while speaking
"The spell exits my body..."
>You feel a hoof rest against your head as Celestia leans over you
>"Why do you allow yourself to be hurt like this? It pains me to see you injured so often."
"I was... Performing my duty, Princess."
>"I know, my little one, I know. Doctor Hinez will be in shortly to help remove those arrows before I use my magic."
"We don't have to wait, Princess. I know you are very busy."
>With that, you wrap your hand around the arrow in your shoulder and give it a solid tug
>The arrow tips made by the cultists proves their lack of resource and the smooth point slides out without much resistance
>A little blood flows freely from the wound as you rest the arrow to one side of your bed
>Celestia looks on with morbid curiosity as you continue to rend the next two arrows from your torso
>"Is it strength or something else that allows you to be like this?"
"I am sorry, Princess, but I do not understand the question."
>The final piece is a little more difficult to reach as you feel around for the roughest edge in your gut
>A spear of this shoddy craftsmanship would make you laugh, if laughing did not cause blood to gush from you right now
>Fatigue begins to set in as you work the wooden pole from your abdomen
>This actually hurts quite a bit, but you know all pain is temporary
>You stop as the pole is halfway out and breathe deeply
>Sweat beads on your face and your hands feel a little numb
"P-Princess... If I may be... s-so bold to ask..."
>You look at the stick running through you and you gesture lightly
>"Hold my hoof..."
>The Princess' beautiful hoof extends towards you and you look over her fine, white coat
>In all the time you have known her, you cannot think of a time when her radiant coat had ever so much as a blemish
>Your hand finally takes her hoof and you hold her tightly
>A magical glow encircles the stick and you feel the pressure as it is pulled free
>You squeeze the Princess' hoof without thinking you may hurt her and pant roughly
>"There we are, little Anonymous. Rest now, your duty is complete for another night."
>With the burden of your Princess lifted, you feel at one with the peacefulness of the beautiful mare
>A red handprint sticks to Celestia's hoof as she relaxes your hand and you feel her magic pull at the energy of the world
>The familiar glow surrounds you, crawls into every hole on your maltreated body, and fills your head with lovely thoughts of sleep
"Thank you, my Princess. Forgive me for... Dirtying your... hoof..."
>The last thing you see before your eyes close is your beloved Princess smiling down upon you
>How do you repay a goddess?

>There is no pain in your dream and your body is not marred with scars from the past
>As you soar through the sky, you spy a light blue cloud that looks so inviting
>You land easily with your muscular body and tuck your wings to your side
>Gazing down from your perch, you can see the whole of Canterlot and you smile
>Duty unto death, you think as you lean a bit further over
>A voice calls through the night air as softly as the breeze itself
>"Sir Anonymous, 'tis a strange sort of place to be thinking of your work."
"Princess Luna, good evening. How is the night?"
>"It is well despite you being here."
"Do you not like when I am in this plane?"
>"I do not like when you take that form. You know the dangers of shifting your body."
"Ah, so you have told me..."
>You stand before the Princess and flex yourself lightly
>Your wings stand out and reveal your cutie mark to the Princess of the Night in the most shameful display you can think of
"Is it not pleasing a form?"
>You watch Luna smirk once and sigh lightly
>She lands on the cloud beside you and it grows wide enough for the two of you to comfortably sit
>"Your body must be injured again. Do you wish to tell me what happened?"
"Of course... Nightlight and myself were releasing the prison. Most unfortunately, we were attacked by a small group cultists."
>"I see, did you defeat them?"
"Of course, dear Princess, as no evil will be allowed to make a mockery of your law."
>"Did you execute them?"
>Luna's face is tense as she awaits your answer
"No... Forgive me, but I had hoped Nightlight would be ready to begin fighting at the front line. I issued her the order and she did not comply."
>"It is fine, Anonymous. Was Nightlight hurt?"
"Lucky, she is an excellent fighter. She was never in any real danger with how the cultists fight. They are weak and sloppy."
>"I must go see your body when you return to the waking world."
>You move in a little closer and smile widely
>Your tail twitches gently in the cool air as you press your side into the Princess'
"Why waste time when this body is more to your liking?"
>"My word, Anonymous, how can somep0ny so hurt even think about -that-?"
"I feel wonderful right now. We have not had a single meeting like this in ages."
>You nip at her flank once and growl lightly between your perfect smile
>Luna titters once at your playfulness before standing to her height
>"What of Nightlight?"
"She is a beautiful mare who has a strange taste in human flesh. This is, however, a simple dream, correct?"
>You unfurl your wings again and engulf Princess Luna's view
>"A most interesting way to think of it, Anonymous. How do you believe she would feel?"
"If she would not allow me to dream, surely we would be in a bad position for our romantic entanglement!"
>Luna saunters up to you, her muzzle just slightly taller than your own, and her eyes pierce you in their icy gaze
>"Do you think this is what a mare looks for in a lover, Anonymous?"
"Truly? I do not know. I like to think a powerful body would lead to some interest. Are my wings not beautiful?"
>"You have quite an imagination, I will admit..."
>She places her horn to your head and you feel a tingling of memories for a moment
>"... Yet, you overanalyze the wishes of a mare from time to time."
>You watch as the dreamscape twists and the form of Nightlight appears before you
>Your wings lower as you watch the little mare look around
>"Oh, hello, sir. Have you seen Anonymous? He's kind of a tall guy? Walks on two legs?"
>A laugh escapes you as you speak to the filly
"It is I, Nightlight."
>"What? You don't -look- like Anon."
"Believe me when I say that I am Anon. I can prove it, if you so desire."
>"OK, what is Anon's duty?"
"To protect the castle, the Princesses and their interests."
>"No, no, you got it all wrong!"
>You stare at Nightlight for the moment and the Princess chuckles lightly
>"Anonymous' duty is to love me..."
>Nightlight suddenly presses her lips into your own and you share a kiss for a short moment
>"I should really go find him... You're a lousy kisser compared to him."
>As quickly as she appeared, she is gone from your dream
>Luna laughs into a pearly hoof as you stare to her
"I am glad you are enjoying yourself."
>"That was simply a memory of your own played against you. Do you see what I mean?"
"Nightlight loves the Anon she knows."
>"Are you still that Anonymous? Are you still in love with her?"
"She -did- disobey me on the battlefield. But, she was just doing what she felt Celestia would want... I cannot fault her for that. Yes, I love her."
>"Do not be too short with her. She is still young and full of the wonder and joy of life."
"This is true..."
>You casually walk to Luna and lie your body against her
"... That was an unfair exercise in dream weaving."
>"I took your mind away from the issue. Is that not a lovely dream in itself?"
>You chuckle and look at the beautiful Princess of the Night
>She looks back with starry eyes before you dart your muzzle in for a kiss
>You feel her try to pull back but, your hoof is too quick for her
>Pressing Luna's head closer, you probe her mouth once with your tongue before letting her free again
>The kiss breaks with a wet pop and her eyes roll back 
>You simply smile and stare at her
"Did you enjoy that?"
>"Anonymous, you beast... So forceful..."
"Compared to my human tongue, this stallion version is much longer..."
>"Fine, but I am on -top- this night! Last time, you hurt my spine from how rough you pushed me down."
"You just kept scream for more, I merely complied."
>"I feel Nightlight developed such a sharp tongue from being with you. It is no wonder she would disobey her superior..."
>You push your face into Luna's neck as she tries to reprimand you and you give her a solid nibble with your powerful jaws
>She loses her focus and gasps at your teasing before you feel a hoof wrap around your neck and hold you closer
>"You are terrible, Anonymous... Lusting for your princess in such a shameful manner..."
>Her body draws into your lap as your top half is push down
>"Now, suffer the consequences of your misguided actions!"
>You feel an exhilarating heat near your groin as Luna mounts you and begins to rock her hips
"I am yours to be used, Princess. Do as you want, do not spare me from your wrath!"
>She chuckles as her mane falls over a single eye
>"Prepare for a lesson in humility. You will beg me to stop once we begin!"
>Your stallion parts begin to grow at the lustful smell and the rough grinding
>Luna's thighs draw you against her body as she glides up and down your pole with a smirk
>"You always imagine this filthy shaft to be so long..."
"... I know you enjoy it when it barely fits."
>Luna lays her body across you and your faces meet
>"If you wake up before I climax, I will personally have you whipped for making me this hot."
>Her muzzle meets with your own and her tongue joins the fray
>You feel hot thighs threatening to pull in your throbbing sex as the Princess becomes more and more daring
>The warm breath of your princess washes over your ear as her voice coos tenderly
>"Hold me tightly lest I slip off."
>Your hooves find their way around the princess' shapely body and her wings spread slowly
>She stares at you with the faintest hint of lust on her face and you lift your mouth again to give her a peck on the cheek
>Luna gasps as a smile parts her face and you part her marehood
>Ebony wings wrap around you as your dream becomes a little more interesting

>In a sterile, white room
>Be Rosewood
>You have been with the injured mare since her surgery let out a few hours ago
>Her sleeping form looks so peaceful on the bed and you imagine how nice a good rest would be
>Your head considers what will happen when your fellow fighters are well again
>Will you be forced back out into the cold to fight for resources another day?
>Questions come and go with not one having a clear answer
>You decide a stroll outside will help clear your head and you set to your hooves
>As you exit the infirmary, you see the clouds turning pink and orange in the distance
>The sunrise is already upon you and you yawn as sleepily as a newborn foal
>It climbs slowly into the sky as you begin to pace about the staircase
>You wonder to yourself about moving so freely about the castle
>Surely, a guard will recognize you and stop you
>With a light step, you descend the stairs and slowly move through the courtyard
>You notice that most of the guards are changing stations in some practiced routine manner
>The bat ponies that make up the bulk of the midnight crew stagger off to bed while the day walkers begin to make their rounds
>There is something strange about ponies who are awake all day and sleep at night, you think
>You wonder if the sun hurts their eyes as much as it does your own as you trot alongside the wall
>A stallion quickly lifts his head as you pass by and glares to you once
>"You there! This is the guardsp0ny staging area!"
"S-sorry, I didn't mean..."
>He quickly interrupts and rushes towards you
>His muscular body and smartly kept blur mane radiate obedience in the growing sunlight and you stare up at him in awe
>A shield cutie mark rests proudly on his flank and his gleaming armor shines like ten moons
>He speaks again, but in a surprisingly friendly tone
>"You're one of Celestia's students, right?"
"Uh, uh..."
>"The magi's quarters are in the left wing of the castle. Right near the library... Are you OK?"
>This stupid, hunky stallion does not even know who you are
"Y-yeah, I'm fine..."
>"If you want, I can take you to it?"
"No!"
>Your voice is a blast as you lose control of your pitch
"Ha ha, I mean, no, thank you! I will be fine, thanks."
>You nervously chuckle to him as you walk back towards the infirmary
>As you approach the medical wing again, you look back over the crowd to see the white stallion standing proudly amongst his kind
>His horn glows with a great power for the moment and you can feel the pull of the universe in your very bones
>With one magnificent, masculine discharge, the unicorn pierces the sky and a bubble forms around the whole of the castle
>It glows a bright pink before fading into a translucent shell and your mouth gapes in awe
>Such power, such strength of will, such a tight backside!
>The last thought replays in your mind as the stallion turns and the world slows down
>His gorgeous eyes lock with your own and, for the moment, you feel the strangest sensation that he is calling to you
>Life resumes as the clueless hunk walks away in his regal way and your lungs gasp for air
>You find yourself a little exasperated as you reenter the building
>Walking through the hall, you come upon a room where a familiar figure lies
>The strange smell of warm blood fills your nostrils as you look on to Anonymous' sleeping body
>You survey the area once before sneaking in and closing the door
"Well, look at this... Now the shoes on the other hoof, you horrible thing, you!"
>He does not reply and you cautiously approach
"This is not nearly enough suffering for something like you."
>You press a hoof to his chest and watch it depress into the bed
"How easy it would be to just suffocate you right now..."
>You stare over his body and lick your fangs in morbid delight
>Your stomach aches as you think of the warm liquid he so selfishly keeps to himself
"You hurt my kind, you hurt me... You are not a pony, just a beast."
>Anonymous suddenly twitches and murmurs and you jump back several feet
>With your guard up, you see he is only having some dream
>You approach him again with a hushed tone as you narrow your eyes on his shoulder
"This is a pittance of what you owe me for the pain you caused."
>With a steady motion, you mouth clamps down around the warm flesh and your fangs sink into Anon with little resistance
>Warm blood fills your mouth quickly and you nearly gasp in the intoxicating taste
>Your body quivers with delight as you are allowed to feed freely
>There is a sudden taste to his blood that you feel after so many sips
>A sort of magic that feels light and airy in your mouth
>You withdraw your mouth as your belly feels contentment and you stare at the neat puncture wounds on him
>Before your very eyes, golden tentacles burst from the holes and lick the wound clean as they recede
>The injury is healed in a matter of seconds and you stare at this level of magic in fear
"Regeneration? It can't be! What in the world -are- you?"
>You wonder in sheer terror just what Anonymous is made of and feel a bit of worry for drinking his blood
>You begin to put the clues together
>If he naturally regenerates, fights like a daemon, and cares little for pain, then Anonymous is some sort of troll!
>It all starts coming together now, yet you are unsure when trolls were so small or in the service of ponies
>You simply shake your head and turn to leave
>A creak suddenly rings out into the still air as you watch the door open wide to reveal a small filly with a few packages in her mouth
>"Anof, guess whaf I brouft 'ou!"
>She freezes in place and you do the same before Nightlight drops the packages and her face contorts into something wholly brutal
>"-You-!"
"I was just leaving..."
>Before you can finish your sentence, the green blue barrels towards you
>Her eyes are filled with some fury you cannot register and the next thing you feel is being tackled to the ground
>"What are you doing to Anon!?"
>Her voice is a roar like that of a manticore
"Nothing! I was just... Just here!"
>"Liar! I'll kill you if you did something to him!"
>Her hoof raises up and her teeth grit as you try to speak
"Wait! Wait! I drank some of his blood! OK? I was just hungry and it happened, but he's fine!"
>Nightlight growls through her teeth and stares at you sharply
>"I gave you a chance before and you almost killed us. This is the second time I gave you a chance and you still do these horrible things."
"Horrible things? That monster tortured me for days without end!"
>"And he gave you his blood to make sure you didn't die."
"That was only to get information from me!"
>"What information could an empty, red-head like you even have?"
"Plenty, you ugly, snot-green tart!"
>"Who're you calling a tart, you tramp?!"
>You see a bright yellow glow envelope the mare pining you down before she is hoisted into the air
>She dangles upside down in the magical field as the False Princess herself enters the room
>She speaks with a mildly angered voice
>"What is the meaning of this?"
>Nightlight pleads with Celestia and gestures wildly
>"I came in to bring Anon some food when I caught this traitor trying to harm him!"
>Celestia lifts an eyebrow to you and glares easily
>"It this true, Rosewood?"
"I wasn't trying to hurt him, I swear! I only took a little drink of his blood!"
>You hope that by saying what you were doing, you will be forgiven to some extent
>The green filly continues to hang in Celestia's magic as she sticks her tongue out at you
>You scowl before Celestia steps forward
>"Rosewood ... I want you to leave this room and do not disturb Anonymous any longer until he is well enough to speak on his own."
>There is something in her voice, like care or sympathy, as she speaks of the beast on the bed
>You stand to your hooves and quickly make your way out of the room
>The oppressive aura of the False Princess fades as you make your distance
>Her magic is so vast that it feels as if your awareness was being pressed between two sheets of glass
>You duck into the first room your see with an open door and try to hide from Nightlight and Celestia
>Your ears ping about as you listen for movement until the sound of a yawning screech rings out in the room
>"Oh, me head... Feels like I went three rounds with that bugger from Stalliongrad."
>You look over to see the two fighters from last night laying in beds just opposite each other
>The one with the eye patch speaks up a second time and you try to place his curious accent
>"Took me eye, the bloody git... Least I got a right jab at his innards. Oy! Who's this now?"
>He looks to you and scowls lightly
"I'm Rosewood..."
>"Fan-bloody-tastic! Glad we was sent to find you just so we's could get all banged up! Oy! Pokey, look it who showed to the party."
>The other stallion cannot turn his head with the neck brace on and you wince at the implications
>"I can -not- look behind me, you foal... Say it one more time and I'm going to shatter your teeth."
>"Yeah, yeah, be mad at me, ya' lucky git! Least you still got two eyes! I ain't ever gonna draw me bow again."
>The other stallion simply sighs
>"Why don't you shut up for five minutes? Just five minutes?"
>The stallion next calls to you from his fixed position
>"Rosewood... I did not think I'd see you again. It's me, Pokey."
>You walk around to the front and a chill runs up your spine
"By the Queen! I have not seen you in ages!"
>"I wish we were still planting cacti in the garden, my dear..."
>You sum up his wounds to find a few abrasions over his muzzle, but not nearly as much damage as Anon had inflicted
>Nightlight seemed to have only hurt Pokey's spine, still bad, but he will recover
>You look to the other stallion and he sighs loudly
>"What? What are you gawking at?"
"What is your name?"
>"Me? I'm the best archer in Equestria! Can't believe ya' never heard of me... Name's Snapshot."
"I am sorry we have to meet like this... I had no idea how to stop you three from attacking after that moronic filly issued the challenged."
>Pokey looks to you with weary eyes
>"It's not your fault. Who knew about that creature they had in their arsenal?"
>"Yeah, what's it s'pose to be anyways? Some kind'a minotaur?"
"It is called a 'human', they are viciously dangerous creatures. This particular one is called 'Anonymous'."
>Pokey frowns to you and turns his eyes
>"Do they have more here?"
"None that I've seen. What I do know is, fighting Anonymous is surely going to result in death. I do not think he was even trying to kill you three."
>Snapshot laughs once
>"Don't tell me he wasn't fighting at his full strength?"
"He can be much more ruthless than that... I think... I think he was enjoying the idea of being attacked."
>"Well, that's a sick sort'a thing, ain't it?"
>"Very troubling, but you look like you are doing well."
"I was being freed that day when you three appeared. When I first arrived, I was being tortured nearly every day for information."
>"You didn't tell them anything, did you?"
>You turn from Pokey sheepishly and sigh quietly
"I did... They broke me, but you don't know how horribly cruel Anonymous can be!"
>Pokey just looks down and sighs heavily
>"Why did you even join the resistance? You don't belong fighting a war."
"We should have never had to fight to begin with. I've been thinking over the last few days that maybe the Queen isn't actually helping us like she said."
>"Don't be a dumbo! A'course the Queen's helping us."
"When was the last time we received relief or aid? When was the last time we didn't have to eat vermin?!"
>"But, Rosy, don't you see? It is all Celestia's fault for creating the divide?"
"I don't know who to blame anymore, Pokey! I'm just so sick of fighting... I want to go home."
>"I understand, it's hard on all of us right now. We are fighting to make tomorrow better for our loved ones back home."
"Since when has fighting made it better? When did war magically fix famine? These ponies may be living in the lap of luxury, but they're..."
>You catch your tongue before it can say anything more
>"But, what?"
"This place is getting to me..."
>"It sounds like it, Rosy. Do you think we'll be able to escape?"
"We won't have to... They're going to let us go freely..."
>"You -have- been in this place to long. Celestia's guards stormed into our home and killed our brethren, why would they suddenly let us go?"
"I... I don't know..."
>You stare at Pokey with tears in your eyes
>Nothing makes sense anymore to you
>Trust is just another way to say hiding the truth in a smile
>How can you trust anyp0ny or anything after spending time with Anonymous?
>Snapshot suddenly perks up
>"Well, I don't care much, meself. I'm just in it for some food. The job's pretty good too. Outdoorsy, plenty a' work... Guaranteed ya' won't go hungry!"
>You hear a stomach rumble from one of the two and chuckle lightly
>"Guess it's been a day or so since we've eaten anything..."
>"Tell somep0ny who cares, mate! Haven't seen a rat in this place since I opened me eye."
>You approach a cooler in your room and find it stocked with chilled blood bags just as in the other surgical room
>They keep a lot of these blood packets just lying around and you almost wish to understand why
>You toss one packet to Snapshot and bring the second packet to Pokey
>"This is... It is!"
>Snapshot bites into the bag with vigor and determination before you hear the sound of a suckling pony
>"What in the world?"
"Don't ask questions about this forsaken place..."
>You prop the bag on your hoof and help Pokey place the other bit into his mouth
>With a delightful groan, you watch the bag shrivel before you
>The room has an eerie sort of quiet to it now as the two fighters feed happily
>It does not last long as the bags run empty
>"I cannot believe this... It is so pure, almost distilled!"
>"Beats the piss outta rats!"
"There, now that you are feeling better, I think we can discuss what to do next?"
>Snapshot and Pokey look to you as if you hold the answers
>This day is just getting longer and longer...

>In a room with a view
>Be Princess Celestia
>You look down at Nightlight with sorrow on your face and then over to Anonymous
"Little one... What happened that night?"
>She looks up to you with wide eyes and then focuses on the body
>"We were ambushed... Three of them. We fought hard to defend the lands in your honor."
"You did well, but how did Anonymous get so wounded?"
>"It is my fault, Princess..."
>You look to her until she begins again
>"... Anonymous issued I kill the wounded fighters. I have never done something like that before, Princess. I was too worried to do it. It distracted Anonymous and the enemy impaled him."
>You nod sagely, taking in the whole scene
>"Had I just obeyed him, he'd be well today."
>A sniffle rises from Nightlight as she approaches the bed and rests her front half on the wooden ledge
>"Why is Anon so hard on ponies, Princess?"
>It takes you a moment to decided what to say, but you sigh
"He feels he is below us, Nightlight. He thinks we do not see him as an equal and that we would show him no respect. Instead, Anonymous clutches to what he believes is right. Anonymous is not a pony and can never understand what it means to live like us. You must accept this."
>"But, he knows I love him, right? That should prove everything!"
>You shake your head
"Anonymous thinks that love is fickle, that it can change. Where he comes from, that may be true."
>Nightlight looks up to you again before taking Anon's hands in her hooves
>"I wish I could show him better. I've been a terrible special somep0ny."
>You approach Nightlight and rest a hoof on her shoulder
"No, Nightlight, I do not believe that. Anon cares for you very much or he would not have even trained you this far."
>"W-what do you mean?"
"Anon's service to Princess Luna ended some time ago. He has not been in charge of watching your grow in all this time, but instead, Anon has wanted to stay by your side."
>The green filly smiles through her tears
>"I had no idea..."
>She turns back and looks over Anon
>"He's going to wake up again, right?"
"I am sure he will, little one. Now, you should get some rest."
>She nods lightly and yawns once before stepping from Anon's room
>You close the door and return to Anonymous side
"I hope you awaken again, Anonymous, but not just yet..."
>You rest yourself beside the bed and lay your head on his chest
>His heartbeat is low, but steady and you admire the strange rhythm it makes
>You check is bandages to see some of lined with fresh blood and think they will need to be changed soon
>Looking up his body, you see his face at rest and bring your own muzzle towards him
"I miss your company, oh -Destroyer-. Your sense of humor had always kept me entertained. Please come back to me soon... Our time is short."
>You plant a small kiss on Anon's forehead and stare lovingly to him
>All you have been preparing for will soon come to pass and the prophecy will be fulfilled
>Who would have though parting was such sweet sorrow?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Night How Long Was I Out? in Equestria
>Be Anonymous
>With a simple farewell to your midnight lover, you feel the world around you shaking
>Consciousness begins to take hold of your mind and you slip easily into reality
>Upon opening your eyes, you discover a small package of food resting on your legs and the sound of snoring rises in the quiet air
>Nightlight sleeps just feet away from your bed in a rather uncomfortable position
>You reach for the foodstuff with a minor pain radiating in your shoulder
>The smell of preserved meat is simply heavenly as you shovel in the entire container
>Feeling rejuvenated, but far from full, you pull yourself from the bed and slowly set to your feet
>Everything aches, but you know it will pass soon enough
>Nightlight snoozes easily as you toss a blanket over her and decide to discover what you have missed
>You step out from the room and a medic stumbles back in surprise
>"A-Anonymous! When did you wake up!?"
"Just now; Status report."
>They look to you for a moment and you realize they have nothing to offer
>You take a few steps forward without another word before they call out to you in a huff
>"You shouldn't be walking! You need to heal, we need to tell the Princess."
>You stop quickly and the sound of following hoof beats ends abruptly
>With a quick twist of your being, you press your face into the personal space of this pest
"Yes, alert the Princesses of my return. Tell them I hunger."
>The pupils of the frightened pony shrink to that of a needle's head as fear takes hold
>They stand frozen in place with scarcely a breath as you pull back and return to leaving
>A sound of a body falling over echoes behind you as you continue towards the courtyard
>Fading sunlight falls over your mostly bare skin as you step outside draped in a simple pair of pants
>The guards on duty tonight quickly salute you as you pass and you pay them the same respect
>One strange addition to the night watch is a bat pony with a blue coat and greenish mane
>You approach him carefully in your usual manner
"Attention, recruit."
>The bat pony stops and turns to you with a faint smile before it fades
>"By the Queen, it's you!"
>You raise an eyebrow at this strange character
"It is me, yes, and who may you be?"
>Looking about nervously for a moment, the pony appears to want to flee
>After what feels like ages, you ask again with just about the same response
>A swift gust passes over your head as another bat pony lands between you two
>You take note of her quickly and spy an injury to her wing
>"What do -you- want?"
"Oh, you, yes... I remember you."
>The pale pony narrows her eyes on you
>"Likewise..."
>You pause for a dramatic moment before stretching
>A small yawn escapes as you blearily wipe your eyes
"It is not always easy to tell where the dreams end and reality begins. I did expect you to have fled by now, but perhaps you have taken it upon yourself to stay?"
>You smile widely as you stand to your full height
>A familiar voice reaches around you and you turn to see a red mane bobbing towards your little group
>"Anonymous! Dusk Dancer! Stop this instant!"
>Rosewood skids to a halt before you
>"We don't want any trouble, Anonymous."
"Trouble?"
>You chuckle as you flex your fingers into a fist
"No, we certainly would not want that now."
>With a mild tension in the air, you hear a screech from overhead
>Nightlight swoops down beside you with practiced grace and stands as proudly as you could ever hope
>"Anon, you're alright!"
"Yes, I am. How about yourself?"
>"Oh, uh, haha, I'm fine... Did you get the package I left for you?"
>You smile, but your reply is interrupted by some garbled mess of a language
>"Oi! I found a bar an' let me tell ya', the wine's bloody good! Heh, bloody! Ya' get it? 'Cause... It's blood!"
>The stallion walks a few feet forward with a bottle in his hoof before falling over
>He lays there for a moment before looking up at you
>"Hey, how'd ya' get so tall there, fella'?"
>The pale pony simply sighs before turning her attention to him
>"Just one day from home and you are already sloshed. Damn it, Snapshot, this is not a game!"
>"I'll say it ain't! I'm broke an' almost outta wine!"
>Snapshot rolls halfheartedly in place as he takes another sip from his bottle
>"Eh, lighten up, Dusty, We're all dead as door nails in the mornin' anyways! Pokey! Pokey, c'mere! I want you ta' know that I always liked you the best, mate."
>Pokey sighs
>"Forgive my friend for his actions, everyp0ny."
>The blue stallion trots easily to Snapshot and Helps him over one shoulder
>"Well, it was, er, a pleasure to see you all again. If you'll excuse us."
>The two stagger off as Rosewood and Nightlight lock eyes
>Dusk Dancer glances at you before turning to Rosewood
>"I think we should leave soon, Rosewood. This place is not meant for us."
>She glares at you and Nightlight once
"If the Princess so wills it, but for now, you are my very welcomed guests."
>"I do not require a prison suite, thank you very much."
>You chuckle and it seems to unnerve Rosewood
"No worries, those are reserved for the help."
>You shoot a curious eye to Rosewood who shrinks back in return
>"I... I think we better be heading to the infirmary, Dee Dee."
>Without warning, a thunderous blast strikes behind Dusk Dancer
>A beautiful Alicorn as radiant as the moon exits the flash
>"Loyal subjects, I hath arrived!"
>Luna stands before your group in all her glory
>You and Nightlight bow in time as Rosewood and Dusk Dancer stand mesmerized
>A display of power is always an excellent way to introduce oneself, you think
>The princess smiles as warmly as springtime
>"Dusk Dancer, I presume?"
>"Yes, it is I."
>"Excellent! I had heard what had transpired between you and Sir Anonymous, but I am glad to see you still stand tall."
>"Yes, we bats are trained to be resilient."
>"Ah, yes, that is a fine quality to find in you Thirsters."
>"Hah, thank you for rekindling old prejudices, -Princess- of the Night."
>Luna looks sternly for a moment before she begins to pace
>"Now, I did not come here to pick a fight or bicker of bygone archaisms. No, rather, I have a much more desirable offer instead."
>You look to Princess Luna carefully as she circles about
>"You see, Dusk Dancer, I wish to lend my hoof and crown to your tribe and assimilate them into our modern society. The task, as daunting as it may be, can only be achieved through careful understanding and trust."
>"Then you would plainly see, Princess, that this is already not in your favour. What -exactly- do you wish to gain from me?"
>"I am looking for a spokespony, somep0ny that can bring a message to the downtrodden."
>Dusk Dancer looks to Luna with increasing scrutiny
>Rosewood pipes up as she slowly approaches her friend
>"Dee Dee, please consider this proposal. Don't just throw away an offer before you give it full thought."
>Luna smiles to Rosewood and then to you with some knowing intent gleaming from her teeth
>"Now, if you would, Dusk Dancer, I would like you to stay at the castle for a few days and eat what you desire and drink what you will. I would like you to learn about Canterlot first-hoof."
>You throw your hands up in astonishment as the words sink in
>Would Princess Luna give a traitor free reign so easily?
>Dusk Dancer looks to Rosewood again and then to the Princess
>"I cannot be bought! You cannot simply hope to persuade me after all the pain you and your army has caused!"
"If I may... War did not start on our end. We are merely a solution to a problem."
>"You foul creature! How dare you insist that -we- somehow started this fight!"
"I had not implied such a thing."
>Implying you do not know who is to blame for all of this
>"My mind will not be changed with your offer, Luna of Canterlot! I shall fight and die or live free, but never shall I compromise with murderers."
>You laugh lightly
"Then how do you live with yourself?"
>Your egging-on final takes its toll and a hoof flies towards you
>To Dusk Dancer's credit, she is fast and rather precise
>You feel a hoof sink into your gut as you tighten up your abdomen
>The feeling of a hard something presses against you and you get a tingling sensation in your spine
>It manifests as a laugh rolling up your throat before Dusk Dancer withdraws
>She stares at you with some mix of fear and resentment as you settle down
>"Foul daemon..."
"Name calling and violence? Yes, you cultists are exceedingly bold."
>Nightlight goes to tend to your stomach, but you quickly set her at ease
"Princess Luna, we should make arrangements to rid the castle of such rats with wings in a timely manner."
>Luna sighs lightly with you
>"I thought the offer was most pleasing. We do only look to help."
>Rosewood stands between both you and Dusk Dancer as she ponders
>"What if they are telling us the truth? What if they really want to extend an olive branch?"
>"I'll never forgive them for the innocents that died. How can you suddenly start forgiving after your brother was struck down in public?!"
>Rosewood hangs her head in a shameful manner and you grow curious
>Luna shoots a glance at you and you subtly return the gesture
>"Dear guests, we shall return by daybreak after you have given time to review our offer. For now, I must depart!"
>The Princess' horn glows with a dark fury before a spell encircles the world
>You look around at everything as it begins to slow before you
>Grass lays still, the hang feels heavy, and the ponies around you freeze in place
>Luna moves steadily on her pearly hooves as you step away from the time-locked group
"A public display of power kills one of their own and it endorses a war... That is interesting news."
>"Yes, Anonymous, do you fear the same as I?"
"We have dealt with a rebellion as this in the past, but to use the same simple tactic again is just deplorable. Investigation?"
>"I worry sometimes that you may read my mind."
>You smile and smartly salute the Princess
"Hundreds of years of practice, dearest Princess."
>With a nod of her head, you feel the spell release you to resume your nature place in the world
>A strange popping sensation fills your ears as the sky and earth sing in tune with you once more
"Come, Nightlight, it appears our guests do so enjoy the night air."
>The two of you quickly head over to your barracks

>In a cozy bed
>Be Nightlight the Joyous
>Anon closes the door as you hop onto the bed with an apple in your mouth
>The juicy green morsel feels perfect around your teeth and your tongue plays delicately along the pierced sides
>"Nightlight, we have a new task."
>You bounce your eyes and squeak from your apple-stuffed throat
>"The mission is to gather more intelligence on this incident that Dusk Dancer spoke of. If we killed somep0ny, we will have a record of it."
>You swallow the bit of apple and speak briskly to Anon
"Got it! So, I'll hold down Dusk Dancer and you punch!"
>"Excellent means of immediate information gathering, but I fear that method would not work properly in this particular case."
>You frown a bit as it seemed like the best course of action
"Do you want me to, I don't know, -talk- with Dusk Dancer? Should we talk to traitors?"
>"I am going to head towards the archives... You find a way to learn more from Dusk Dancer or even her cadre."
>You salute Anon with the apple clenched tightly between your teeth
"Sir, yeth, Sir!"
>He smiles with you and your heart flutters about
>It is good to have your superior officer back, you think, as you jitter lightly in excitement
>Within the hour, you are bathed and out the door to begin your latest assignment
>You decide you will go to the easiest source of information first as you happily tip-hoof around the castle grounds
>With grace, tact, and all the ease you can muster, you find yourself before Rosewood
"Hey, Rosewood..."
>Her ears pick up as she looks to you with a bit of anxiety
>She raises a hoof to her chest and you nod you head earnestly
>With a bit of apprehension, she approaches you with a faint smile
>"Yes?"
"It is good to see you here this night."
>Her eyes bounce around you for a moment
>"Good to see you too?"
"Great, now that that's out of the way... What do you know about what Dusk Dancer was speaking of?"
>"What was Dusk Dancer speaking of earlier?"
"You know? The whole, 'Public killing' thing and all that?"
>She stops and looks at you with a face that surely Anon could read, but the hidden message is lost on you
>"Why do you want to know?"
"Because!"
>You start to grow frustrated with Rosewood
>She stares at you for a moment with a hint of confusion on her face
>"You are acting strangely... Please leave me be."
>Rosewood turns from you with a quick flip of her tail and begins to leave
>In your panic, you catch her tail in your mouth and yank her back towards you
"You have to tell me!"
>"Let go of me!"
"Tell me about what happened first!"
>"No, you stupid, snot-green lunatic!"
>You give her another hard pull and Rosewood slides across the floor
>Huffing slightly, she stands up and her horn begins to glow
>"You are as bad as that Anonymous!"
>You feel the pull of energy as Rosewood begins her conjuring and prepare yourself to fight
>A blue stallion suddenly slides into your view as Rosewood's magic fades
>"Enough! What in the world are you two doing?"
>You remember this stallion from the day he attacked you
"I was just trying to find out what happened is all."
>Rosewood pins her ears to her head as she speaks
>"She attacked me, Pokey, I was merely defending myself."
>Pokey turns his attention to you and his eyes narrow
>"Shame on you for picking on Rosy. What is bothering you so much that you would be roughhousing?"
>You kick up your front hoof and look shyly at the ground
"I just wanted to know what Dusk Dancer was talking about when she said that somep0ny was publically killed."
>Pokey looks to you and then to Rosewood with a serious demeanor 
>"You should go and rest. I'll be over shortly."
>The tall stallion walks close beside you before scooting you along with him 
>Rosewood disappears as you are lead outside by Pokey's lead
>"Nightlight, correct?"
"Yes. You're Pokey, right?"
>"Exactly. Now, what are you trying to learn from us?"
"I wanted to know the story of how this war began."
>"I see... Has the minotaur put you up to this?"
>You stop and think for a moment
"Minotaur?"
>"Yes, that tall creature that you seem to accompany."
"That's Anonymous and he's a human, not a minotaur. I suppose, yeah."
>"Either way, this is rather personal to Rosewood and I would appreciate if you do not ask her or say anything while we are here."
>You make the gesture of zipping your lip and end it with a smile
>"Right, well OK. A royal guard squadron appeared one day while we were going about our daily routine. They came in gleaming armor with weapons drawn and a tithe to pay. Up until their very arrival, we had never been in contact with Canterlot, so much of us were confused about this new show of force."
>You walk on through the grounds until you come upon a small garden that you never noticed before
>Pokey steps in happily and sniffs at the air with delight
>"Wildflowers, simply fragrant."
"So, this payment that the Princesses must have wanted, whatever happened?"
>Pokey stands idly by a plain green shrub as if he is searching for something
>"We did not have what was requested, but the guards would have none of that. They told us that they'd take what they could to equal the value. A stallion named 'Thornwood' did not want to give away his hauling cart or his herbs and spices and..."
>You see Pokey's face twist and his jaw grit
>Connecting the dots, you frown alongside him
"They... They killed him, didn't they?"
>Pokey nods as he sighs deeply
"And that started it all? That's why Thirsters had to fight back?"
>"No... We would have never fought back in our weak state. We did not practice the art of combat nor did we have weapons. Ours was but a simple farming village, too poor to even have quality metal tools."
"So, what happened?"
>You look at Pokey with hopeful eyes as he digs his hoof into the ground
>Scraping back some loamy soil, you see Pokey drop a hoof worth of seeds into the ground
>"A savior came in our desperation. She came silently into the occupied town shortly after the pillaging began. In a matter of hours, her powerful magic had scattered or destroyed the Canterlot guards."
>Pokey covers up his freshly planted lot and sighs again
>"She said she came from the far north and that, if we served her now then we could expect peace and prosperity."
"I assume that that's the Red Queen, right?"
>"Yes, but she calls herself 'Queen Nightshade'. For a time, it was good. We did see some growth in our crops and things began to look up. Though, before we realized, we would be attacked again by Canterlot."
>You think hard about what Anon has told you about the Red Queen before speaking
"But, I heard the Red Queen was sending ponies to attack us! That army in Canterlot hasn't been mobile against the Thirsters at all."
>Pokey stops for a moment and his nostrils flare
>He walks up to you with a menacing look on his face and you steel yourself
>"What do you mean they are not mobile?! We were attacked just two days before discovering Rosewood's whereabouts!"
"But, me and Anon only learned where the Red Queen was hiding the day we met you..."
>"No, but, that does not make sense... That is... It is..."
>You see Pokey struggle for a moment and notice the mark on the side of his neck begin to shine with a faint white light
>"The... Queen... S-save... The... Queen!"
>Pokey's eyes go blank as they are engulfed in a white light that shines with an unnatural coldness
>His face twists and contorts to expose his long fangs
>Before you now stands some empty shell of a pony as it turns its attention on you
>With a hiss and a snarl, the ensorcelled Pokey lunges for you
>His attack pins you under his size, but you have dealt with larger foes before
>A swift kick into his gut dislodges the manic bat pony long enough for you to subdue him
>To Pokey's credit, his body thrashes and his wings beat roughly against your sides
"Pokey! What is wrong with you?!"
>You struggle to restrain him as you feel a sharp pain in your leg
>Pokey's fangs pierce into you and you feel the rest of his jaw lock on
>Your mind swims in a stream of fear and anger before a strong gust howls around you
>A voice rings out over the chaos as Luna's imposing form takes shape against the gloom
>"Be still!"
>A sharp bolt of magic expertly blasts into Pokey's face and he releases you leg
>With a few more spasms from his blue form, you see Pokey's eyes roll into place and focus on you
>"W-what... H-happened?"
>He quickly faints before you can regain your voice and you shudder
"Princess Luna, thank you so much."
>"I felt a strange and dark magic appear in an instant. How curious..."
"He just snapped all of a sudden and attacked me."
>You look down at the marks in your right leg and feel the warm blood leak out
>Attempting to stand on it and walk away proves difficult through the pain, but Luna comes to your aid
>Without a word, you feel her magic lift you onto her back and her beautiful, raven-like wings speed towards the castle
>"Dear Nightlight, do you know of Anonymous' location?"
"Uh, um, maybe the library?"
>Your head begins to cloud and your vision blurs
>You feel somep0ny carrying you into a bed and the cool sheets quickly heat up under your being
>The last thing you see is Princess Luna standing over you with a sad look on her face
>"Don't worry... Anon's coming."
>A smile weakly stretches across your face as you fall asleep

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Day Sepsis in Equestria
>Be Dusk Dancer
>You arrive at the infirmary where your comrade is being held
>Apparently, he attacked somep0ny and the False Princess of the Moon retaliated in equal measure
"Where is Pokey? What did he do?"
>An orderly takes you to his room, but does not explain much to you
>Stepping inside, you find Pokey in a cold sweat under a dozen blankets
"By the Queen, is he going to live?!"
>Before an answer is given, the door bursts open and slams angrily against the wall
>The beast known as Anonymous marches in with fire in his eyes
>For a moment, your gaze meets his own and the world slows to a crawl
>The sheer intensity of the monster's stare sends a shiver down your spine until your tail stands on edge
>He disappears behind a sectioned area and you return to trying to find the cause of all this
>It is within moments that Princess Luna enters carefully
>"Dusk Dancer, I presume?"
"That is I."
>"The situations we meet in continue to be dire."
"This seems to be true."
>You stare down the False-Princess
>In your mind, you know that she could cast you to the heavens or break your very will with a single gesture
>Still, you stand tall and defiant
>Luna looks down to Pokey once before eyeing you
>"I sense a dark magic plaguing this one's very blood. Do you know what caused this reaction?"
"I am not certain... Pokey is a kind-hearted pony."
>"His heart is not his own now."
>With a twisted expression, you blurt out against Luna
"Watch your witch tongue! Pokey is a fine stallion who would never hurt a fly!"
>The powerful alicorn before you snaps her head in your direction and glowers
>"But, he would injure my little ponies."
>There is an intensity to her words the likes of which you are not familiar with
>Pokey convulses from his dream-like state
>His legs twitch and his throat pulses for breath
>"S-save... P-protect..."
>You watch his body undulate before falling limply in a painful spasm
>Sweat builds on his brow as his eyes clench against the pain
"He's becoming delirious. He'll die if this keeps up!"
>Luna eyes Pokey's throat for a moment and you begin to worry
>"I sometimes worry Anonymous is influencing me... But, that is not the path I have chosen to walk."
>A sudden intensity emanates from Luna as her eyes glow a brilliant yellow
>Her horn shines like the very moon above and you feel your very being pulled at the frail edges of reality
>A powerful spell erupts from her horn and strikes Pokey at his neck
>His body arches on the bed and a terrifying choking noise forces its way out
>You hear the metal railing rattle as hooves thrash in maddening pain
"What have you done?!"
>"Only time will tell..."
>With her cryptic words, the False-Princess leaves towards her beast servant
>You watch powerlessly as your friend writhes in agony

>A short distance away
>Be Anonymous
>You kneel beside the short bed of your dear Nightlight
>Placing your hand on her forehead, she is hot yet her body shivers under a mound of blankets
>The Princess of the Moon strides in with the smell of freshly peeled ozone around her
>Princess Luna looks to you and her glance brings a chill to you
"The puncture wound... It is poison if ever I've seen."
>The Princess looks to you with a bit of a smile, but it is far too hollow
>"Anonymous, would you say Nightlight's will is strong?"
>You nod slightly
"Yes, she is stubborn."
>"That is good to hear."
"This is not your average poison, is it?"
>Luna confirms your fears with a simple nod
>"This is no poison at all, Anon. It is a dark and powerful magic that threatens the heart of its victims."
>You snarl quickly
"No doubt... Is there a cure?"
>"Time, patience, and determination."
"I pick one. What can I get to remedy this ailment?"
>"Anon, it is not that simple. Magic must cure magic."
"I will do anything to have Nightlight well again."
>She smiles with you before walking beside the bed
>"I know you would, Anon. Honestly, this is a fine sight to see. I just wish it were not at such a dark time."
>You hold the warm hoof of Nightlight as you stare at her limp features
>Breaking your contact, you quickly stand and sober up
"We must redouble our efforts to find the Red Queen. We must push deep into enemy territory and end her reign by whatever means."
>"Anonymous, calm down and rest for the moment."
>You stare at the ceiling with an expression between hatred and sorrow
"I will break this spell if it means breaking every bone in her body."
>"That... That won't necessarily stop the magic from progressing."
>You begin to head out the door
"It will at least make me feel better..."
>Silently, you pray to the sun and moon
>This is your fault, you know
>You failed to protect her, but you will not lose Nightlight so easily

>Outside, under fading starlight
>Be Dusk Dancer
"Damn it all!"
>You kick the ground and slur angrily
"That fake Princess is certainly going to kill him! I know it. How do I fix this? Damn it, Dusk, get it together! You're supposed to be the team leader!"
>A sudden sound picks up from a corner of the yard
>"More like a shepherd of the damned."
>You turn to see the creature known as Anonymous 
>"Look at you, disheveled and weak. Fear is the only thing you know, you filthy creature."
>His words flit like bitter gnats in the air
"It is you who are an abomination on this place!"
>He stares at you with a hard face of unnatural proportion
>"The Princess keeps you alive in here, but you will not always be in this space. Think hard about your next words."
>You scowl and pin your ears before the beast
"I want nothing to do with this hideous castle of putrid gray! My team will leave and take what we came for."
>"The one called 'Rosewood', hmm? Such a favour would almost make me feel inclined to reimburse you."
"You are a foul pox on this world."
>"Perhaps your world is larger than my own. Tell me, do you know what is happening right now to either pony in the medical ward?"
>You stop and pay attention now
>"They are dying of a magical malignancy. My sentry is dying to your attack while yours is dying from his own queen. What do you make of that? Tell me you are not blind enough to believe the Red Queen cares for your misbegotten kind?"
>For the moment, you want to throw yourself upon Anonymous
>You wish to attack with all your might, to silence his mouth and black his eyes
>But, for the moment, he is correct and you are confused
"I am sure this is not an intended side effect..."
>"Perhaps you are correct or, perhaps, it is exactly what was needed to silence two ponies. When will you be the next?"
>Having had enough, you charge the creature headfirst
>He catches you before you realize what is happened and you feel the ground meet your back quickly
>Winded, you roll away and gasp for air
>"You are weak and expendable to your precious queen. You do her bidding blindly."
"You are wrong!"
>With great speed, you dive at the beast and connect with his torso
>It is like hitting a lump of stone under your hoof and leaves you thoroughly shocked
>His strange arm swings to the side and slams you in the ribs
>The blow is staggering and you find yourself on the ground again
>You attempt to lift your body, but the pain in your side rings into your back
>"Know now that I can break you whenever I please and learn now that only the Princess' infinite mercy keeps you whole!"
>A swift kick sends you a foot into the air as your stomach violently lurches
>Bile churns in your gut as the pain radiates into your hind legs 
"You... D-d-damn..."
>"Pain is temporary..."
>Anonymous bends over with his face just inches from your own
>"... Failure is forever."
>He slowly rises to his full height and begins to walk away
>You do not think you have ever been hit so hard in your life
>Laying on the grass, tears well in your eyes as you attempt to move
>Your legs are useless as the pain roils about
>In a mercifully short time, you finally pass out

>Be Anonymous the Enraged
>Leaving the defeated pony behind, you stomp onwards to the castle
>There must be some cure hidden in a book, you think
>The library is lively today and this makes you smile
>Not often do you find yourself here and help would be greatly appreciated
>There is a small unicorn in one corner with a periodical in hoof
"You there..."
>You approach casually
"... I am in need of some assistance."
>The unicorn looks over her paper and yawns slowly
>"Who are you?"
"I am Anonymous, castle guard. I am looking for a particular spell book."
>"Hmm, spells are under 'M'. Do you know the type of spell you want?"
"Cures, both magical and palliative."
>"Start in 'M35' and work your way down. If you hit 'N', you've gone too far."
>The unicorn raises her paper up again and covers her face
>A light snore and grumble flit up from behind her screen
>You begin to make your way through the massive library and scan the shelves for interesting titles
>It feels like hours of walking before you come upon a small green book
>You quickly grab it from the shelf and muse over the title
>Supernaturals: Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super
>This has worked in the place for strange malignancies you have come across
>Your mind wanders back to the mysterious outbreak that sprang up outside the castle and how this book held a simple cure
>The vomiting and joint pain you remember as well
>Racing from the library, you decide it is time to read!

>On the castle grounds with the sun kissing the horizon
>Be Rosewood
>You are exhausted after this long night
>Another day at the castle, you think, is bad for your health
>Having not seen anyp0ny in a while, you canter off to towards the western wall
>In the early morning light, you see a white pony slumped on the ground
>You instantly recognize her as Dusk Dancer and rush to her side
"Dee Dee? Dee?"
>You push a hoof on her side to nudge her
>A painful yelp rings out and you hop back
"Dusk?"
>"R-Rosewood?"
"Are you alright?"
>"No, I n-need to get on my hooves..."
>You slide around to her other side and roll your body into her own
>It is a slow process, but you eventually get your friend upright
>Her face winces in pain and you notice a large bruise down on side of her body
"What happened here?"
>"Anonymous..."
"That brute attacked you?! How dare he! We need to escape from this place and get you help! We need..."
>A gesture silences you as Dusk Dancer walks towards the castle
>"... I attacked first."
>You stare in bewilderment with the lame pony beside you
"Why? Why you even associate with him?"
>"Recklessness... Please, take me to the infirmary."
>You prop Dee Dee against your side as you two slowly make your way to the grey palace
>Stepping inside, you notice that there are few medics on staff
>Dusk Dancer does not stop, but instead, nudges you towards a particular room
>You help her in to see Pokey laying on a bed and Princess Luna standing over him
"I need just one day, just one, were I don't see anyp0ny laying in a hospital bed..."
>Luna turns to the hobbled Dee Dee and raises a curious eye
>"Are you injured?"
>She turns her face from the Princess and mutters
>"I fell down some stairs."
>Luna slowly nods
>"I see... Would you like some treatment?"
>Dee Dee politely refuses as she limps towards a chair
"Princess... Is Pokey sick?"
>The shimmering mane of Luna parts as her face peaks through
>"He will recover. Do tell me, Rosewood, how do you feel?"
"I am feeling, well, honestly? I feel better than I have in a while. I still want to go home, though."
>For a moment, the Princess looks at you with a sadness in her eyes
>She takes a smooth breath and closes her eyes
>Within the blink of an eye, Luna vanishes as the smell of ozone fills the room
"... So... Anyp0ny else hungry?"

>Be the Princess of the Night in the early break of day
>You feel the vibrations of magic about and race to your sister
>Within moments, you arrive in a crackle of energy outside of your sister's quarters
>You quickly push in her door and discover Celestia reading through an old tome
>She does not notice your approach as her horn glows with a blackness you have never seen before
>It is you who breaks the silence on your whispers
"Dearest sister?"
>Celestia quickly turns to you, her eyes aflame with nausea energy
>Her spell suddenly breaks as she comes to
>"Luna! What are you doing here?"
"I felt a strange energy growing..."
>You look about before staring at you own hooves
"... And I was confronted with something I did not expect."
>"What? What did you find?"
>You look up to your sister with a stern eye
"You first; what is this you are doing?"
>"Luna, it's a spell, you... You wouldn't understand this."
"I am just as well verse in magic as you and I have a lot of time to waste!"
>You beginning lightly tapping a hoof on the floor
>Steady at first
>Tap tap tap tap
>Then you build momentum
>Taptap tap taptap tap
>Celestia scowls as you continue to rap at the floor in this annoying rhythmic step
>"Luna!"
"Tell me!"
>"Fine!"
>Your sister's voice is a blast before she slinks down into a whisper
>"I am worried."
"That does not..."
>"... Luna, you are so young still. You have a life before you filled with difficult choices all your own. I fear, I have made a grave mistake."
"I am certain we can fix it together?"
>"No, I have given into this fight and I have let it go on so long. It is Anonymous, I fear what is coming."
"Have we not raised Anonymous to his fullest? Did we not prepare him for such battles that hold the fate of kingdoms?"
>"We did, but... But, we let him push his limits too far. He is a beast of nature and has always taken more to see where we would stop him, to see how far he could go before we would intervene."
"This is true, but what has you so concerned that you practice such dark magic?"
>"Anonymous is different, we have always known this. However, what if... What if we could 'cure' him?"
>You look to your sister sternly
"'Cure' Anonymous?"
>"What if we could divide him? Take away his darkness and his fear and show him what life is when you are happy?"
"Oh no, dear sister, we had tried such a spell on lesser beings with utter catastrophe."
>Celestia sulks as she lays upon her bed
>"He will find this Red Queen and he will do everything in and out of his power to destroy her. I fear not only for the collateral damage, but for Anonymous himself."
>You mull over the idea a bit
"Yes, that sounds like Anonymous' way. He has always been feisty. He just does what he can to fulfill his orders, to please us."
>"Do you know where he has been all night and where he still resides?"
>You shake your head and await your answer
>"He is killing adolescent hydras in the swamps for scales and blood."
"Prey tell, to what end?"
>"Nightlight has a fever..."
"I told him it was a magical illness!"
>"He is bent on making a magical salve."
>You put your hoof to your head and sigh
>"Do you ever wonder how he experiences the world? It is as if he is outside of himself, watching from beyond his own body as the remainder of his being does whatever it is he deems necessary."
"Sister, I think you should rest on this situation. I will personally see to it that Anonymous does not cause too much damage."
>"Do you think Anonymous will live much longer?"
>You stop for a moment in confusion
"Yes? I suppose he should? Why do you ask?"
>"I fear that the coming battle will be his end. You must know, I have seen you in my dreamscape."
"True, you have been plagued by nightmares, but Anonymous has always come out of such engagements in one piece, usually."
>"This time will be different... I think I will take up your offer on the nap after all."
>You smile to your dear sister and approach her
"I will watch the sun this time..."
>You place your horn against her own and a little spark arcs to your sister
"Sleep well, older sister, I will do what I can to alleviate your fear."
>"Thank you, Luna."
>Celestia lies on her bed and softly drifts off to sleep
>You turn your attention to the general direction of the bog and puff up your chest
>Anonymous is old enough now
>It is time to have "The Talk"

>Day 100 EXP in Equestria
>Be Anonymous, explorer extraordinaire
>With a quick stab, you fell your tenth hydra
>Hydra killing is thirsty work, you think, as you drain the last bit of water from your canteen
>As you carve out some large scales to reach the gallbladder, you feel an intense energy build in the air
>A cloud of dark fog rapidly builds before bursting
>It is the lovely Princess Luna and she does not look too pleased
>âAnonymous!â
>Her royal tone makes you feel like a child for the moment
>âJust look at this mess! Why are you thinning the hydra population further!?â
âI needed these materials, Princess. I am justâ¦ stockpilingâ¦ For an emergency?â
>You try to smile through your lie, but Luna will have none of it
>âWe are leaving immediately.â
>You scowl, but succumb to your Mistressâ wishes
>With your pack loaded to the brim, the Princess and you teleport away
>You are practiced at this spell and ride the fabric of time easily
>The world changes from the swamps to the pristine castle of Canterlot and you smile
âI apologize for scaring you.â
>âI was not worried about you as much as the extinction of the swamp denizens. Why must it always be hydras when you are angry or disappointed?â
âI was only a little angry, dearest Princess. The book does actually call for quite a few hydra organs.â
>You brandish your little green book in your gore covered hand
>Princess Luna frowns quickly
>âWhy do we even have that book in the library? I am going to bury it under the tallest oak I can findâ¦â
>Clutching the book to your chest, you look to the Princess with sad eyes
>âOh, donât you give me that look, mister. You have abused the so-called âCure-allsâ for quite some time.â
>Perhaps you have relied a bit heavily on this book, true
>Luna sobers up as you both walk towards the barracks
>âAnonymous, I need to speak to you in private. We have plans to discuss.â
>A smile parts your lips as the serious intonation of planning sinks in
>The Princess abruptly stops and places an outstretched hoof against your chest
>âBut, first, bathe yourself. You smell of hydra stomach and mundungus.â
>You nod quickly as you cheerfully trot with your spoils towards home

>In a fevered dream
>Be Nightlight
>You are flying high above the clouds with the warm sun against your back
>It is a lovely day, you think
>You scan the ground from your position until you spot your target
>Swooping low, you dive for the unassuming prey
âGotâcha!â 
>You quickly snatch Anonymous up in your hooves and smile widely at him
>He is rather small compared to you
>âHello, Nightlight.â
>His voice is a little shy, but isnât he always?
âAre you ready to go on an adventure?â
>âAs ever, faithful sentry.â
>Yes, you are a faithful sentry, arenât you?
>Spotting an interesting bramble, you decide it looks like it is worth investigating
>Dropping down, you gently release Anon so that he stands on his own
>âHmm, this place reminds me of a long and sorted battle, of which I was victorious, naturally.â
>Anon puffs out his chest and smiles
>You salute your mentor smartly
>He really is amazing when you get right down to it
>Fearlessly, Anonymous charges into the thorny brush and quickly disappears
>You follow your stalwart leader, but find yourself a little too large to easily maneuver
>After a short while of navigating the prickly bramble, you come upon a large space at the center
>Before you is a large throne, made of wood and vines
>Upon it sits a magnificently large pony, not unlike Celestia herself
>Her mane is beautiful, red and rust colored with green leaves interwoven throughout
>A curved, red horn rests neatly on her head and her wings remind you of fallen autumn leaves
>Nestled in her large hooves is the body of Anonymous
>For the moment, you can see him resting peacefully with his eyes closed against her
>A heady, windy voice suddenly calls to you from the throne
>âNightlight, sweet little pony, come to me.â
âWho are you?â
>âI am Lady Holly, dear Nightlight.â
>You look around at the scene as something nags at your mind
>âPlease, come to me. Anonymous has, you should follow your dear mentor.â
>Anonymous does not seem to stir from his sleep
âAnonymous, sir!â
>The small figure barely seems to register your voice before Lady Holly speaks up
>âNightlight, why would you wake him? Look at how peaceful he is. You want him to be happy, yes?â
>Of course you want Anonymous to be happy, but this sensation of wrongness eats at you
âI need an order to follow anotherâ¦â
>Anonymous suddenly springs to life and looks up from his nap
>âCome, Nightlight, it is so peaceful with Lady Holly.â
âWhat about our adventure? Our duty?â
>âEvery soldier needs a rest. Even Celestia rests sometimes.â
>You stop and grade his words for a moment
âWho?â
>Anon smiles a little and rests his head against Lady Holly
>âCelestia, the princess. You must be very tired to forget.â
>You scowl and feel a weight at your shoulder
>A spear, your spear, materializes from thin air and you ready yourself
âAnonymous does not speak like that... What have you done to him?â
>Lady Holly only smirks casually as Anonymous falls back in her hooves
>âCome, Nightlight, join usâ¦â
>The thorns around you seem to close in
âNo!â
>There is a sound of a sudden snapping and you see the large throne bristle with thorns
>âI said come!â
âAnd I said no!â
>A vine moves in for your back hoof, but you quickly dodge it
>Another tries to strike from the ceiling, but you stab it into the floor
>âWhy do you resist? It is better to serve me than to fight.â
>A red flare of leaves and thorns rises from the throne and you instantly realize what you are staring down
âThe Red Queenâ¦â
>Lady Holly cackles as more thorns attempt to overwhelm you
>You scowl and only show fear for a moment
âAnonymous will come for me.â
>âNo one will comeâ¦â
>The Queenâs voice is like an angry wind
âHe will rescue Rosewoodâs village.â
>Lady Holly grimaces at your defiance
>âThey are mine to control!â
>The vines twist angrily as you beat them back
âAnd you know what else?â
>The False-Queen hesitates for the moment and growls at you
>Smiling widely, you look her straight in the eye
âAnonymous -will- defeat you.â
>She roars as her eyes flash crimson and a thousand angry vines whip towards you
>You will not fail in your duty
>You will not fail them

>Be Anonymous
>After a quick bath and some unregistered alchemy, you meet with Princess Luna
âDearest Princess, you wished to speak to me?â
>Luna reads over a large tome and hardly peeks over the edge
>âYes, Anonymous, please have a seat.â
>You find the simplest chair you can before sitting
>âNightlight, as I have told you before, has been infected by a magic spell delivered through a bite. The only one that could break it now is her.â
âI understand this, but, perhaps just a bit of intervention from me couldâ¦â
>The Princess slams her book closed and looks to you
>âAnonymousâ¦ Anon, please understand that both my sister and I have given Nightlight aid. Much like we have done when you are injured.â
âI trust you, I truly doâ¦â
>âBut, you are frightened?â
>You stop for the moment and turn your head from your Princess
>âIt is natural, Anonymous. Your fear, your anger, all natural reactions to this situation. It is how you act upon your instinct for your friends that truly gives shape to such events.â
âI have killed ten hydras in the bogs from dusk âtil dawnâ¦â
>Princess Luna sighs with a smile on a her face
>âAdmirable, if nothing else. You are devoted and I am proud to see you have grown to cherish another.â
âThis would not be my first pony to cherish, dear Princess. There is yourself and Princess Celestia.â
>âHmm, I suppose, but have you ever called us, even I, friend?â
>You pause for a long moment as you decide your words
>It is all for naught
âNoâ¦ No, I suppose I have not. You are my superiors, I worship you.â
>You plead from the heart with your Princess
>The Princess slowly rises to her hooves and strides beside you
>Her warm body presses into your own and she wraps herself about you in an endearing hug
>âAnon, how small you were when we found you and how unwise we were in your developmentâ¦ You walk the path we once did tread, but time has shown you are loyal.â
>You carefully raise your arms and lightly return the embrace
>âThis pain you feel is unlike any other, but I promise that is normal for friends to feel this sick over each other. We will see Nightlight through these dark times.â
>Your fingers grip onto Princess Lunaâs soft fur and you place your head on her shoulder
>Her majestic wing wraps around you and you feel safe for but a moment
>âYou are a fine friend, Anon, I know Nightlight thinks so too.â
>A tear slips down your face and lands lightly onto Lunaâs fur
>âIt is not weakness, that which makes us cryâ¦â
>The Princess tries to comfort you
ââ¦ Then why am I upon my knees?â
>Friendship is suffering

>Day Pony Up in Equestria
>Be Anonymous
>It has been three nights since Nightlight has fallen ill and you visit her regularly throughout your daily routine
>It feels strangely empty to practice and prepare without her, but duty calls as ever
>You find yourself amongst others at the wall tonight, each of you heaving loads of ammunition or piling sandbags as you go
>A familiar pony is at the gates and you recognize her as the Princessâ protÃ©gÃ©
>Her dark mane parts about her horn as her magic glows
>Sigils of some kind appear on the large gate as she enchants it
>âThere we go, all done.â
>A nearby guard smiles and bows
>âThank you, Ms. Sparkle.â
>The little unicorn smiles widely before turning about and walk towards the castle
>A strange sort of curiosity overtakes you as you begin to follow the young mare
>She is completely oblivious to your shadowing
>You follow her into the castle and watch her enter the library before disappearing
>Princess Lunaâs voice rings out from behind you
>âAnonymous, are you snooping?â
âAs usual, dear Princess. Can you tell me of this Twilight Sparkle that Celestia holds so dear?â
>âA pet project of my sisterâs, from what I understand. The purple one is a wellspring of untapped raw magic. Very temperamental and hardly will associate with her peers.â
>Princess Luna smiles widely
>âSound like somep0ny you know?â
>You shake your head and turn to face the Princess
âAre there any reports on Nightlightâs condition?â
>âStable for now, but magic does not have such a predictable course as disease.â
âDo you believe she will live?â
>You grade the Princessâ expression carefully as she speaks
>âShe is strong and she yearns for lifeâ¦ I believe so, yes.â
>The Princess and you walk about for the moment before your stomach rumbles
>âWhen was the last time you ate?â
âI have no taste for food right now.â
>âNonsense!â
>A large wing encircles you from behind
>âYou must keep your strength up for your duty! Come, let us have a meal together.â
âYou do not worry about rumours of fraternizing with the help?â
>A smile creeps up your face
>âIt can be a concern, yet I can always send my attack dog after naysayers.â
>Princess Luna returns the smile in earnest

>In a garden apart from the others
>Be Rosewood
>You gingerly step through the loamy soil as you ponder
>Is it truly difficult for the false Princesses to cure this magic?
>You wonder what other powerful spells the Queen possesses before hearing the snap of twigs
>Pinning your ears and wheeling around, you spot a familiar pony
>He does not notice you as he walks with his head held high and his armour shines in the pale light of the moon
>You quickly take cover behind some brush and listen carefully
>His voice is slightly young, but charming all the same
>âThis is terribleâ¦ Weâre surely going to mobilize for war.â
>A very familiar voice picks up and makes your stomach quiver
>âYes, we will. Is that not pleasing, captain?â
>âNo, Anon, it is not.â
>You peak from your hiding place to see the handsome stallion standing before Anon
>To your surprise, Anon is kneeling before him and speaking softly
>âIt is what we have been working for. This has all been your plan.â
>The stallion snorts
>âThe plan was a good defense and sturdy bulwark, not full-scale assault!â
>âForgive me, captain.â
>The regal stallion places a hoof to Anonâs shoulder
>âAlso, stop acting like Iâm so much better than you. Itâs weirding me out. You did nothing wrong to apologize for.â
>Anonymous rises and nods
>âI just wish to show respect to you, Shining. You earned your title and rank. Still, do you not yearn for the thrill of battle?â
>âItâs justâ¦ Well, itâs not that I donât want to protect Canterlot, itâs just that we need to find a better way than attacking. Itâs not our way, you know?â
>Anonymous contemplates deeply and smiles
>âYou are correctâ¦ What would the Princess think of us if we charge headlong into blood confrontation?â
>Anonymous swiftly spins his arm around and directs his fist to his captain
>The regal stallion puts up a shield of pure magic so quickly and with such force that he deflects the blow
>You gasp for the moment before covering your mouth as sparks fly from the monstrous impact
>Anon shakes his hand a few times and his eyes travel toward the brush you are in
>âSharp as ever, Shining. With your impenetrable shield and my unstoppable force, I dare say we can topple dragons.â
>âAnonymous! That is -not- funny! You know I donât like sparring.â
>âI also know you do not prefer to deal with spies and traitorsâ¦â
>Anon picks up a rock and quickly hurls it at your location
>You harden the brush before you and it easily stops the small rock
>The regal pony now takes a defensive stance and growls
>âWho goes there?!â
>Cautiously, you step from the entanglement and try to sound bold
>âIt is I, Rosewood.â
>Anon sighs for a moment as if he really was expecting something else
>âOh, she is just one of the traitorous dogs of the Red Queen.â
>The regal stallion looks curiously at you and seems to size you up
âIâll just be going nowâ¦â
>With a flash of magic, the shining stud teleports before you
>He is larger than you in both height and girth and his piercing eyes send a chill up your spine
>The oddest fragrance of lilac and wild berries emanates from about him
>âRosewoodâ¦ I have heard about you.â
âG-good things, I take it?â
>He raises an eyebrow to you and you wince
>âEasy now, Iâm not going to hurt you.â
>Anonymous audibly sighs again before turning away and crossing his arms
>âI am Shining Armor, captain of the royal guard and envoy of the Princesses.â
>Your heart throbs for a moment as you stare up at this stallion
>He is the first pony you have met in this awful castle that has not made you scared for your life
>âWhat business do you have here tonight?â
âI-I was just taking in the moonlight.â
>He looks confused at your answer
>âNo, I mean, like, what did you hope to find out by spying on us.â
âHonestly, I was not spying!â
>A sudden gale rises in the still night and you shield yourself
>Luna appears in the air upon the whims of her magic and gently touches down
>Her voice is thunderous as she speaks
>âAnonymous! You are required at the castle!â
>Anonymous and the false princess speed off towards their sordid castle, leaving the guard captain and yourself alone
âS-so, um, I suppose we are aloneâ¦â
>He eyes you carefully before smiling
>âWhy do you look so nervous?â
âOh, it is justâ¦ Strange.â
>âYes, I bet. Donât worry, weâll protect you so long as youâre in the castle walls. We donât have to be enemies here.â
âWe donât?â
>âI mean, unless you want to?â
>He snorts lightly with a cocky smile on his face
âNo! Of course not!â
>An uncomfortable silence grows as you both stand across from each other
âAnonymousâ¦â
>âHmm?â
âWhat kind of âthing- is he?â
>With a sigh, the regal guard begins telling you of a very different creature than you have come to know

>In a wicked dream
>Be Nightlight
>You escape and run until your legs burn and your breathing is rough
>A ringing you cannot place persists in your ears
>It is a voice you have yet to forget and, yet, have never fully heard
>Wicked words and cruel thoughts fill your head as the whispers continue
>âYour friends will abandon you.â
âShut your mouth!â
>You slap yourself quickly before looking out on the horizon
>A twisted ocean of brambles and dark, thorny bushes spills out in all directions
>âYour heart will explode.â
âQuiet!â
>Building up your courage, you leap and unfurl your wings over the sea of thorns
>You must escape and find Anon!
>The Red Queen must be stopped!
>You flap your leathery wings with all your might as you stay above the grasping vines and sharp thorns below
>The sun is a blood-red ember in the cloudless sky and you feel like you are roasting as you soar
>âYour strength will fail.â
>Words bore into your mind with visions of a decaying land around you
>A large object comes into view amongst the ruins
>The smell of decay and blood and acid rises up
>Sitting atop a mountain of broken and slain bodies is the Red Queen
>Her eyes glow with voraciousness as she licks her lips
>âGive me your lifeâ¦â
>Vines slither and crawl upwards towards her and engulf the bodies below
>ââ¦ And never feel this pain again.â
>You cannot stand one more uttered breathe from this monster
>With a roar of defiance, you dive at her
>Your spear appears in your grasp as you speed down and makes contact with the Red Queen
>A sickening popping noise and then a crunch rings out into the open air
>The Red Queen growls and throws you to her hooves
>âImpetuous whelp! Bow to me!â
>You hop up and take hold of your weapon
>Another twist and thrust sends it further into the beast before you
âThat is not an option! Fight, overcome, or die!â
>âWhy do you resist so?!â
>A sudden feeling of relief washes over you as the battle turns in your favour
âBecause there will always be somep0ny there for me!â
>The Red Queen looks distressed and doubles her efforts to entangle you
>Your legs are hooked and your wings are bound, but still you hold the spear tightly
>Pressure builds in your gut as you are constricted and you gasp
>âFight for âme- or die!â
>You choke out a gasp as you bury the spear as far as it will go
>âNo pony will save you!â
âY-yesâ¦ Heâ¦ Willâ¦â
>A bright light emerges and breaks across the sky like a bolt of lightning
>A massive sword follows and embeds itself into the Red Queen
>âWhat is this?!â
>She hisses as her form begins to shatter
>The sound of a large, dark voice echoes into the air as the sun and heat are blotted out
>You look up through teary eyes to see Princess Luna flying overhead
>Another massive sword tears through the heavens and skewers the Red Queen
>âThis is a message!â
>You see another winged stallion in the air above you
>His dark coat and large wings cannot mask the unmistakable presence of Anonymous
>One last sword steadily hovers over the Red Queenâs throne
>In a short, cold manner, Anon delivers his coup de grace
>âWe ride on wings of fury.â
>The final weapon slams down on the Red Queen and her form shatters into so much dust
>You find yourself freed of the vines and thorns and your body rests gently on the ground
>Anonymous lands beside you in his odd form and he smiles
>âYou did well, sentry.â
â-We- did well.â
>Princess Luna soon meets beside you two and she joins in with a smile
>âYour will was done, little one. We could only have come in to assist what you had already finished.â
>You wheeze and clutch your pained side
âI-Iâm glad we won. With t-the Red Queen goneâ¦ Weâll live at p-peace now?â
>The Princess grimaces a bit as she looks to you
>Anon rubs his nose into your side and quickly clears his throat
>âNightlight, I need you to wake up now.â
âWhat?â
>âJust wake up.â
âI donât understand?â
>âThat is an order, sentry.â

>In a soft bed
>Be Nightlight the Awakened
>You spring to life with a terrified shriek as you sit up and look around
>Princess Celestia and Anonymous are standing nearby and there is a tray of food beside you
âIt was all a dream?â
>You pat yourself all around to make sure all your limbs are attached
>Confirming such, you sigh and look up to your guests
âYou would not believe the nightmare I had.â
>âWe were there and you did well.â
>Princess Luna smiles with you
>Anonymous passes you an apple slice
>âI am relieved to see you awake again
>You salute weakly
âOrders are orders.â
>He cracks a smile and Princess Luna seems to be in awe
âI remember that pony, Pokey, losing his mind and biting me. How did I end up here?â
>The Princess trots carefully around the bed
>âYou were poisoned with a magic bite. In your comatose state, it threatened to consume your being. Your will was what ultimately allowed you to survive.â
>âNever would I doubt her stubbornness.â
>Anon nods sagely with his grin plastered to his face
>Princess Luna smirks lightly
>âSomething you would be an excellent judge of.â
>You chuckle, more to clear your throat than anything, before taking a bite of your apple
>A sudden and intrusive voice seems to echo throughout the room
>âYour friendsâ¦ deceive you.â
>You look around as paranoia overtakes you
âDid you hear that?â
>âHear what, sentry?â
>The room is silent for the moment as you all listen carefully
>There is nothing save for the stillness in the air
âIt must have been my imagination.â
>You stare at your apple and take a deep breath
>The moment of tension passes and you look around slowly
>It was possibly nothing
>Probably
